    HISTORY:

    1/20/03     awi     Wrote it.

    5/27/05     mk      Add while-loops around mach_wait_until, so no problems with interruptions...
                        New routine PsychWaitUntilSeconds() for waiting until a specific time.
    1/03/09     mk      Add generic Mutex locking support as service to ptb modules. Add PsychYieldIntervalSeconds().

/* PsychYieldIntervalSeconds() - Yield the cpu for given 'delaySecs'
 *
 * PsychYieldIntervalSeconds() differs from PsychWaitIntervalSeconds() in that
 * it is supposed to release the cpu to other threads or processes for *at least*
 * the given amount of time 'delaySecs', instead of *exactly* 'delaySecs'.
 *
 * If one wants to wait an exact amount of time, one uses PsychWaitIntervalSeconds().
 * If one just "has nothing to do" for some minimum amount of time, and wants to
 * play nice to other threads/processes and exact timing is not crucial, then
 * this is the routine of choice. Typical use is within polling loops, where one
 * wants to pause between polling cycles and it doesn't matter if the pause takes
 * a bit longer.
 *
 * A 'delaySecs' of <= zero will just release the cpu for the remainder of
 * the current scheduling timeslice. If you don't know what to do, choose a
 * zero setting.
