    HISTORY:

        12/20/02        awi         Wrote it mostly by modifying SDL-specific refugees (from an experimental SDL-based Psychtoolbox).
        11/16/04        awi         Added description.
        4/22/05         mk          Added support for OpenGL stereo windows and enhanced Flip-behaviour:
                                    Flip'ing at specified deadline, retaining instead of clear'ing backbuffer during flip,
                                    return of stimulus onset related timestamps, properly syncing to VBL.
        4/29/05         mk          Additional safety checks for VBL sync in PsychOpenOnscreenWindow().
        5/14/05         mk          Additional safety checks for insufficient gfx-hardware and multi-display setups,
                                    failing beam-position queries. New refresh interval estimation code, reworked Flip.
        5/19/05         mk          Extra check for 'flipwhen' values over 1000 secs in future: Abort.
        5/30/05         mk          Check for Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1) -> Shortened tests, if set.
        6/09/05         mk          Experimental support for busy-waiting for VBL and for multi-flip of stereo displays.
        9/30/05         mk          Added PsychRealtimePriority for improving timing tests in PsychOpenWindow()
        9/30/05         mk          Added check for Screen('Preference', 'VisualDebugLevel', level) -> Amount of vis. feedback.
        10/10/05        mk          Important Bugfix for PsychRealtimePriority() - didn't switch back to non-RT priority!!
        10/19/05        awi         Cast NULL to CGLPixelFormatAttribute type to make the compiler happy.
        12/27/05        mk          PsychWindowSupport.h/c contains the shared parts of the windows implementation for all OS'es.
        3/07/06         awi         Print warnings conditionally according to PsychPrefStateGet_SuppressAllWarnings().
        11/14/06        mk          Replace blue screen by welcome text splash screen. Tighten threshold for frame skip detector for
                                    systems without beampos queries from 1.5 to 1.2, remove 0.5 offset and use unified deadline calculation
                                    code for the flipwhen>0 case and the flipwhen==0 case. All this should not matter on systems with beampos
                                    queries, but it makes the test more sensitive on systems without beampos queries, biasing it to more false
                                    positives on noisy systems, reducing the chance for false negatives.
        11/15/06        mk          Experimental support for low-level queries of vbl count and time from the driver: Used for verifying
                                    beampos query timestamping and as a fallback on systems that lack beampos query support.

/*
    PsychOpenOnscreenWindow()

    This routine first calls the operating system dependent setup routine in PsychWindowGlue to open
    an onscreen - window and create, setup and attach an OpenGL rendering context to it.

    Then it does all the OS independent setup stuff, like sanity and timing checks, determining the
    real monitor refresh and flip interval and start/endline of VBL via measurements and so on...

    -The pixel format and the context are stored in the target specific field of the window recored.  Close
    should clean up by destroying both the pixel format and the context.

    -We mantain the context because it must be be made the current context by drawing functions to draw into
    the specified window.

    -We maintain the pixel format object because there seems to be no way to retrieve that from the context.

    -To tell the caller to clean up PsychOpenOnscreenWindow returns FALSE if we fail to open the window. It
    would be better to just issue an PsychErrorExit() and have that clean up everything allocated outside of
    PsychOpenOnscreenWindow().

    MK: The new option 'stereomode' allows selection of stereo display instead of mono display:
    0 (default) == Old behaviour -> Monoscopic rendering context.
    >0          == Stereo display, where the number defines the type of stereo algorithm to use.
    =1          == Use OpenGL built-in stereo by creating a context/window with left- and right backbuffer.
    =2          == Use compressed frame stereo: Put both views into one framebuffer, one in top half, other in lower half.

    MK: Calibration/Measurement code was added that estimates the monitor refresh interval and the number of
        the last scanline (End of vertical blank interval). This increases time for opening an onscreen window
        by up to multiple seconds on slow (60 Hz) displays, but allows reliable syncing to VBL and kind of WaitBlanking
        functionality in Screen('Flip')... Also lots of tests for proper working of VBL-Sync and other stuff have been added.
        Contains experimental support for flipping multiple displays synchronously, e.g., for dual display stereo setups.

    PsychFlushGL()

    Enforce rendering of all pending OpenGL drawing commands and wait for render completion.
    This routine is called at the end of each Screen drawing subfunction. A call to it signals
    the end of a single Matlab drawing command.

    -If this is an onscreen window in OS-9 emulation mode we call glFinish();

    -In all other cases we don't do anything because CGLFlushDrawable which is called by PsychFlipWindowBuffers()
    implicitley calls glFlush() before flipping the buffers. Apple warns of lowered perfomance if glFlush() is called
    immediately before CGLFlushDrawable().

    Note that a glFinish() after each drawing command can significantly impair overall drawing performance and
    execution speed of Matlab Psychtoolbox scripts, because the parallelism between CPU and GPU breaks down completely
    and we can run out of DMA command buffers, effectively stalling the CPU!

    We need to do this to provide backward compatibility for old PTB code from OS-9 or Win PTB, where
    synchronization to VBL is done via WaitBlanking: After a WaitBlanking, all drawing commands must execute as soon
    as possible and a GetSecs - call after *any* drawing command must return a useful timestamp for stimulus onset
    time. We can only achieve a compatible semantic by using a glFinish() after each drawing op.

/* PsychFlipperThreadMain() the "main()" routine of the asynchronous flip worker thread:
*
* This routine implements an infinite loop (well, infinite until cancellation at Screen('Close')
* time etc.). The loop waits for a trigger signal from the PTB/Matlab/Octave main thread that
* an async flip for the associated onscreen window is requested. Then it processes that request
* by calling the underlying flip routine properly, returns all return values in the flipRequest
* struct and goes to sleep again to wait for the next request.
*
* Each onscreen window has its own thread, but threads are created lazily at first invokation of
* an async fip for a window, so most users will never ever have any of these beasts running.
* The threads are destroyed at Screen('Close', window); Screen('CloseAl') or Screen errorhandling/
* clear Screen / Matlab exit time.
*
* While an async flip is active for an onscreen window, the worker thread exclusively owns the
* OpenGL context of that window and the main thread is prevented from executing any OpenGL related
* commands. This is important because while many OpenGL contexts are allowed to be attached to
* many threads in parallel, it's not allowed for one context to be attached to multiple threads!
* We have lots of locking and protection in place to prevent such things.
*
* Its also important that no code from a worker thread is allowed to call back into Matlab, so
* the imaging pipeline can not run from this thread: PsychPreflipOperations() is run fromt the main
* thread in a fully synchronous manner, only after imaging pipe completion is control handed to the
* worker thread. Error output or error handling from within code executed here may or may not be
* safe in Matlab, so if one of these errors triggers, things may screw up in uncontrolled ways,
* ending in a hang or crash of Matlab/Octave. We try to catch most common errors outside the
* worker thread to minimize chance of this happening.

/*    PsychFlipWindowBuffersIndirect()
 *
 *    This is a wrapper around PsychFlipWindowBuffers(); which gets all flip request parameters
 *    passed in a struct PsychFlipInfoStruct, decodes that struct, calls the PsychFlipWindowBuffers()
 *    accordingly, then encodes the returned flip results into the struct.
 *
 *    This method not only allows synchronous flips - in which case it has the same behaviour
 *    as PsychFlipWindowBuffers(), just with struct parameters - but also asynchronous flips:
 *    In that case, the flip request is just scheduled for later async, parallel execution by
 *    a background helper thread. Another invocation allows to retrieve the results of that
 *    flip synchronously.
 *
 *    This is the preferred method of calling flips from userspace, used in SCREENFlip.c for
 *    standard Screen('Flips'), but also for async Screen('FlipAsyncStart') and Screen('FlipAsyncEnd').
 *
 *    The passed windowRecord of the onscreen window to flip must contain a PsychFlipInfoStruct*
 *    flipRequest with all neccessary info for the flip parameters and the fields in which result
 *    shall be returned, as well as the datastructures for thread/mutex/cond locking etc...
 *
 *    flipRequest->opmode can be one of:
 *    0 = Execute Synchronous flip, 1 = Start async flip, 2 = Finish async flip, 3 = Poll for finish of async flip.
 *
 *    *   Synchronous flips are performed without changing the mutex lock flipRequest->performFlipLock. We check if
 *        there are not flip ops scheduled or executing for the window, then simply execute the flip and return its
 *        results, if none are active.
 *
 *    *   Asynchronous flips are always started with the flipInfo struct setup with all needed parameters and
 *        the performFlipLock locked on triggering the worker thread: Either because we create the thread at
 *        first invocation and acquire the lock just before initial trigger, or because we are initiating a flip
 *        after a previous successfull and finished async flip -- in which case we come from there with the lock
 *        held. Also the worker thread is waiting on the flipperGoGoGo condition variable.
 *
 *    *   Async flips are finalized or polled for finalization (and then finalized on poll success) by entering with
 *        the lock not held, so we need to lock->check->unlock (in not ready yet case) or lock->check->finalize in
 *        success case - in which case we leave with the worker thread waiting on the flipperGoGoGo for new work and
 *        our performFlipLock held -- Just as we want it for the next async flip invocation.
 *
 *  More important stuff:
 *
 *    *   Code executing in the PsychFlipperThreadMain() worker thread is not allowed to print anything to the
 *        Matlab/Octave console, alloate or deallocate memory or other stuff that might interact with the runtime
 *        environment Matlab or Octave. We don't know if they are thread-safe, but assume they are not!
 *
 *    *   Error handling as well as clear Screen and Screen('Close', window) or Screen('CloseAll') all trigger
 *        PsychCloseWindow() for the onscreen window, which in turn triggers cleanup in PsychReleaseFlipInfoStruct().
 *        That routine must not only release the struct, but also make absolutely sure that our thread gets cancelled
 *        or signalled to exit and joined, then destroyed and all mutexes unlocked and destroyed!!!
 *
 *    *   The master interpreter thread must detach from the PTB internal OpenGL context for the windowRecord and
 *        not reattach until an async flip is finished! PsychSetGLContext() contains appropriate checking code:
 *        Only one thread is allowed to attach to a specific context, so we must basically lock that ressource as
 *        long as our flipperThread needs it to perform preflip,bufferswap and timestamping, postflip operations...
 *
 *    *   The userspace OpenGL context is not so critical in theory, but we protect that one as well, as it is a
 *        separate context, so no problems from the OpenGL/OS expected (multiple threads can have multiple contexts
 *        attached, as long as each context only has one thread attached), but both contexts share the same drawable
 *        and therefore the same backbuffer. That could prevent bufferswaps at requested deadline/VSYNC because some
 *        usercode rasterizes into the backbuffer and subverts our preflip operations...
 *
 *    Returns success state: TRUE on success, FALSE on error.

    /"missed presentation deadline" detector, which is pretty reliable.
    Allows to not clear the framebuffer after flip, but keep it as before flip - allows
    incremental drawing of stims. Allows to flip not at next retrace, but at the retrace
    immediately after some deadline (spec'd in system time) has been reached.
    Optimizes rendering in collaboration with new SCREENDrawingFinished.c.

    Accepts:
    dont_clear flag: 0 = glClear after flip, 1 = restore backbuffer after flip, 2 = don't do anything.
    flipwhen: 0 = traditional flip (flip on next VBL), >0 flip at VBL immediately after time "flipwhen" has been reached.
             -1 = don't sync PTB's execution to VBL, aka sync stimulus onset to VBL but don't pause execution up to then
                  This also disables all timestamping and deadline checking code and makes synchronization of Matlabs
                  execution locked to the VBL impossible. -> Only useful for very special cases...

    Returns:
    double value VBL start time: Calculated time of VBL start (aka buffer swap) from timestamp, beamposition and IFI.
    beamPosAtFlip = Position of monitor scanning beam at time that timestamp was taken.
    miss_estimate = Estimate of how far we've missed our presentation deadline. >0 == No deadline-miss, < 0 == deadline-miss
    time_at_onset = Estimated time when stimulus onset, aka end of VBL, aka beamposition==0 occurs.
    time_at_flipend = Timestamp taken shortly before return of FlipWindowBuffers for benchmarking.

    Notes:

    The type of timestamping used depends on the 'VBLTimestampingMode' preference setting. Specific numbers
    select specific strategies. If a strategy is unsupported or found to be defective, a fallback strategy is
    tried and so on.

    Mode 4: Use OS-Builtin wait-for-swap-completion and timestamping if supported. On Linux this would be OpenML OML_sync_control.
    Mode 3: Use VBLANK IRQ timestamping - on Linux with OpenML or OS/X.
    Mode 2: Use mode 1 and 3 with consistency checking among both.
    Mode 1: Use beamposition timestamping.
    Mode 0: Use beamposition timestamping, but no VBLANK timestamping.
    Mode -1: Use raw timestamps.

    Fallback sequence, assuming mode 1, 2 or 4 is:

    4:   OS-Builtin (e.g., OpenML) --> Beamposition --> VBLANK --> Raw.
    3:   VBLANK --> Raw.
    2,1: Beamposition --> VBLANK --> Raw.
    0:   Beamposition --> Raw.
    -1:  Raw.

        //
        // While recent NVidia gpu's have multiple command fifo's, the execution of the actual rendering work is afaik mostly serialized,
        // just the scheduling of command streams is offloaded to hardware. In summary, pretty much all shipping GPU's as of beginning 2012

        // flip stuff -- it is pushing the system pretty hard so it will always be more fragile wrt. system load fluctuations etc.

 * Set up 'windowRecord' as the target window for all drawing operations.
 *
 * This routine is usually called from the Screen drawing- and userspace OpenGL <-> Screen
 * state transition routines to setup a specific PTB window as drawing target.
 *
 * It is also called by Screen's internal special image processing routines (e.g,
 * 'TransformTexture' and preparation routines for OpenGL double-buffer swaps to
 * *disable* a window as drawing target, so the low-level internal code is free
 * to do whatever it wants with the system framebuffer or OpenGL FBO's without
 * the danger of interfering/damaging the integrity of onscreen windows and offscreen
 * windows/textures.
 *
 * Basic usage is one of three ways:
 *
 * * PsychSetDrawingTarget(windowRecord) to prepare drawing into the framebuffer of
 *   windowRecord, including all behind-the-scenes management, activating the associated
 *   OpenGL context for that window and setting up viewport, scissor and projection/modelview
 *   matrices etc.
 *
 * * PsychSetDrawingTarget((PsychWindowRecordType*) 0x1) to safely reset the drawing target to "None". This will
 *   perform all relevant tear-down actions (switching off FBOs, performing backbuffer backups etc.)
 *   for the previously active drawing target, then setting the current drawing target to NULL.
 *   This command is to be used by PTB internal routines if they need to be able to do
 *   whatever they want with the system backbuffer or FBO's via low-level OpenGL calls,
 *   without needing to worry about possible side-effects or image corruption in any
 *   user defined onscreen/offscreen windows or textures. This is used in routines like
 *   'Flip', 'OpenWindow', 'OpenOffscreenWindow', 'TransformTexture' etc.
 *   After this call, the current OpenGL context binding will be undefined! Or to be more
 *   accurate: If no window was active then maybe no context will be bound -- Any OpenGL
 *   command would cause a crash! If a window was active then that windows context will
 *   be bound -- probably not what you want, unless you carefully verified it  *is* what
 *   you want! ==> Check your assumption wrt. bound context or use PsychSetGLContext()
 *   to explicitely set the context you need!
 *
 * * PsychSetDrawingTarget(NULL) is a hard-reset, like the (0x1) case, but without
 *   performing sensible tear-down actions. Wrong usage will leave Screen in an undefined
 *   state! All current uses of this call have been carefully audited for correctness,
 *   usually you don't need this!
 *
 * The implementation contains two pathways of execution: One for use of imaging pipeline,
 * i.e., with FBO backed framebuffers -- this is the preferred way on modern hardware,
 * as it is more flexible, robust, simpler and faster. For old hardware and non-imaging
 * mode there is a slow path that tries to emulate FBO's with old OpenGL 1.1 mechanisms
 * like glCopyTexImage() et al. This one is relatively limited and inflexible, slow
 * and convoluted!
 *
 * FastPath:
 *
 * If windowRecord corresponds to an onscreen window, the standard framebuffer is
 * selected as drawing target when imagingMode == Use fast offscreen windows, otherwise
 * (full imaging pipe) the FBO of the windows virtual framebuffer is bound.
 * If 'windowRecord' corresponds to a Psychtoolbox texture (or Offscreen Window), we
 * bind the texture as OpenGL framebuffer object, so we have render-to-texture functionality.
 *
 * This requires support for EXT_Framebuffer_object extension, ie., OpenGL 1.5 or higher.
 * On OS/X it requires Tiger 10.4.3 or later.
 *
 * SlowPath:
 *
 * Textures and offscreen windows are implemented via standard OpenGL textures, but as
 * OpenGL FBO's are not available (or disabled), we use the backbuffer as both, backbuffer
 * of an onscreen window, and as a framebuffer for offscreen windows/textures when drawing
 * to them. The routine performs switching between windows (onscreen or offscreen) by
 * saving the backbuffer of the previously active rendertarget into an OpenGL texture via
 * glCopyTexImage() et al., then initializing the backbuffer with the content of the texture
 * of the new drawingtarget by blitting the texture into the framebuffer. Lots of care
 * has to be taken to always backup/restore from/to the proper backbuffer ie. the proper
 * OpenGL context (if multiple are used), to handle the case of transposed or inverted
 * textures (e.g, movie engine, videocapture engine, Screen('MakeTexture')), and
 * to handle the case of TEXTURE_2D textures on old hardware that doesn't support rectangle
 * textures! This is all pretty complex and convoluted.
 *
 *
 * This routine only performs state-transitions if necessary, in order to save expensive
 * state switches. It tries to be lazy and avoid work!
 *
 * A special case is calls of this routine from background worker threads not equal
 * to the Matlab/Octave/PTB main execution thread. These threads are part of the async
 * flip implementation on OS/X and Linux. They call code that sometimes calls into this
 * routine. The system is designed to behave properly if this routine just return()'s without
 * doing anything when called from such a workerthread. That's why we check and early-exit
 * in case of non-master thread invocation.
