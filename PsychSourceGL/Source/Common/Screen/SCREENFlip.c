	HISTORY:

		09/10/02	awi		Created.
		10/12/04	awi		Changed "SCREEN" to "Screen" in useString.
		04/03/05    mk      Add optional sync/nosync to VBL, don't clear fb on flip, flip after deadline, and return timestamps.
		05/16/05	mk      Add optional flag "dontsync" and some more timestamps.
		06/09/05	mk      Add optional flag "multiflip" for experimental multiflip support.
 
	DESCRIPTION:
  
		Interchanges front and back buffers of a double-buffered display.
		It can be selected if buffer should be cleared to background color after the flip or if
		it is left intact. One can also select to flip after a specific deadline -
		useful for easier timing of stimulus presentation. And Flip returns multiple timestamps
		that help to check proper presentation timing.

	"Flip front and back display surfaces in sync with vertical retrace and return completion timestamps.\n"
	"\"windowPtr\" is the id of the onscreen window whose content should be shown at flip time. "
	"\"when\" specifies when to flip: If set to zero (default), it will flip on the next possible video retrace. "
	"If set to a value when > 0, it will flip at the first video retrace after system time 'when' has been reached. "
	"\"dontclear\" If set to 1, flip will not clear the framebuffer after Flip - this allows incremental drawing "
	"of stimuli. The default is zero, which will clear the framebuffer to background color after each flip. "
	"A value of 2 will prevent Flip from doing anything to the framebuffer after flip. This leaves the job "
	"of setting up the buffer to you - the framebuffer is in an undefined state after flip. "
	"\"dontsync\" If set to zero (default), Flip will sync to the vertical retrace and will pause execution of your script "
	"until the Flip has happened. If set to 1, Flip will still synchronize stimulus onset to the vertical retrace, but "
	"will *not* wait for the flip to happen: Flip returns immediately and all returned timestamps are invalid. A value of 2 "
	"will cause Flip to show the stimulus *immediately* without waiting/syncing to the vertical retrace. "
	"\"multiflip\" defaults to zero: If set to a value greater than zero, Flip will flip *all* onscreen windows instead of "
	"just the specified one. This allows to synchronize stimulus onset on multiple displays, e.g., for multidisplay stereo "
	"setups or haploscopes. You need to (somehow) synchronize all attached displays for this to operate tear-free. "
	"Flip (optionally) returns a high-precision estimate of the system time (in seconds) when the actual flip has happened "
	"in the return argument 'VBLTimestamp'. An estimate of Stimulus-onset time is returned in 'StimulusOnsetTime'. "
	"Beampos is the position of the monitor scanning beam when the time measurement was taken (useful for correctness tests). " 
	"FlipTimestamp is a timestamp taken at the end of Flip's execution. Use the difference between FlipTimestamp and VBLTimestamp "
	"to get an estimate of how long Flips execution takes. This is useful to get a feeling for the timing error if you try to sync "
	"script execution to the retrace, e.g., for triggering acquisition devices like EEG, fMRI, or for starting playback of a sound. "
	"\"Missed\" indicates if the requested presentation deadline for your stimulus has been missed. A negative value means that dead- "
	"lines have been satisfied. Positive values indicate a deadline-miss. The automatic detection of deadline-miss is not fool-proof "
	"- it can report false positives and also false negatives, although it should work fairly well with most experimental setups. "
	"If you are picky about timing, please use the provided timestamps or additional methods to exercise your own tests. ";

	"Schedule an asynchronous flip of front and back display surfaces for given onscreen window. "
	"\"windowPtr\" is the id of the onscreen window whose content should be shown at flip time. "
	"\"when\" is the requested stimulus onset time, a value of zero or no argument asks for flip "
	"at next possible vertical retrace.\n"
	"For the meaning and explanation of all other parameters, see the help for 'Screen Flip?'.\n\n"
    "If this command is called while a previously scheduled asynchronous flip is still in progress, it will "
    "wait for that pending async flip to finish and return its results (timestamps etc.). If no such "
    "operation is in progress, it will return results of the most recently finished async or sync flip. "
    "Waiting for previous flips to complete and returning their results is a convenience function. "
    "In most cases, in order to have more control over "
    "the execution of your script and your flip timing, you will rather want to use one of the finalizer "
	"commands Screen('AsyncFlipCheckEnd') or Screen('AsyncFlipEnd') mentioned below "
	"to collect information about the final result and timing of the asynchronous flip operation.\n\n"
	"The difference between Screen('AsyncFlipBegin',...); and the more commonly used Screen('Flip', ...); "
	"is that Screen('Flip') operates synchronously: Execution of your code is paused until the flip operation "
	"has finished, ie. at least until the requested onset deadline 'when' has passed.\n\n"
	"Screen('AsyncFlipBegin') will prepare everything for a flip at the requested time 'when' - or "
	"at next vertical retrace if 'when' is omitted - but then immediately return control to your "
	"code. Your code can continue to execute and do other things, e.g., schedule flips for other onscreen "
	"windows, perform keyboard or mouse queries, etc.\n\n"
	"You can check the progress state of asynchronous flips or wait for them to finish and collect timing "	
	"information for the finalized flip by use of the commands Screen('AsyncFlipCheckEnd') and Screen('AsyncFlipEnd');\n\n"
	"In general you should avoid using asynchronous flips and instead use conventional 'Flip' unless you have a "
	"good reason to do otherwise, because async flips come with a couple of strings attached:\n\n"
	"- You are restricted in what you can do with Screen() or OpenGL while async\n"
	"  flips are in progress: You can not do anything with textures or offscreen\n"
	"  windows while their parent-onscreen window is in async flip state. You can\n"
	"  only access onscreen windows which are not participating in an async flip\n"
	"  operation.\n\n"
    "- If you enable the Psychtoolbox image processing pipeline, most restrictions\n"
    "  on drawing during async flips are relaxed: You can draw into any windows while\n"
    "  async flips are pending, even the window for which the flip is pending. Only\n"
    "  use of the Screen('GetImage') command is forbidden on async flipping onscreen\n"
    "  windows and potentially problematic on offscreen windows while an async flip\n"
    "  is in progress. However, this is somewhat theoretical. In practice many\n"
    "  operating systems, graphics drivers and graphics cards can't really handle the\n"
    "  load of parallel drawing and async flipping, due to system bugs or design\n"
    "  constraints. On such systems you may observe inconsistent timing, degraded\n"
    "  performance, and on some systems even visual stimulus corruption, malfunctions\n"
    "  or hard system crashes [e.g., Apple MacOS/X 10.4.11 with ATI Radeon X1600]!\n\n"
    "- Even the restricted set of allowed reliably working Screen/OpenGL commands\n"
	"  should be avoided, because some graphics hardware and drivers may not be\n"
	"  able to handle such concurrent graphics operations without degraded stimulus\n"
	"  onset timing accuracy, ie. you may experience more missed stimulus deadlines\n"
	"  and timing glitches -- or inconsistent behaviour accross different computers\n"
	"  and graphics cards or operating system releases. In the end it allows you to\n"
	"  do non-Screen related things like sound, I/O, keyboard checks...\n\n"
	"- Parallel processing of flips puts additional burden onto your CPU,\n"
	"  GPU and operating system, so it incurs additional overhead and may degrade\n"
	"  absolute drawing performance and cause more timing issues and glitches if\n"
	"  your system is not reliably able to handle the concurrent load.\n\n"
	"- Code with async flips - as any piece of parallely executing code - is harder\n"
	"  to implement correctly and more challenging to debug for you.\n\n"
	"- Using a non-zero \"multiflip\" argument is not allowed.\n\n"
	"- Asynchronous updates of gamma tables will likely not work reliably.\n\n"
	"- Stereo stimulus display in stereomode 10 (two separate onscreen windows) will\n"
    "  likely not work with reliable timing or have possible tearing artifacts.\n\n"
	"- Use of the 'UserspaceBufferDrawingPrepare' hook-chain of the imaging\n"
	"  pipeline is not allowed.\n"
