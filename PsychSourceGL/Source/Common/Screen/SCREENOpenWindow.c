    PLATFORMS:  All

    HISTORY:

        12/18/01    awi     Created.  Copied the Synopsis string from old version of psychtoolbox.
        10/18/02    awi     Added defaults to allow for optional arguments.
        12/05/02    awi     Started over again for OS X without SDL.
        10/12/04    awi     In useString: changed "SCREEN" to "Screen", and moved commas to inside [].
        2/15/05     awi     Commented out glEnable(GL_BLEND) and mode settings.
        04/03/05    mk      Added support for selecting binocular stereo output via native OpenGL.
        11/14/06    mk      New onscreen windows blank to their background color after successfull init.
                            Support for specification of pixelSize's for 10-10-10-2, 16-16-16-16 and
                            32-32-32-32 framebuffers on supported hardware.

    "Open an onscreen window. Specify a screen by a windowPtr or a screenNumber (0 is "
    "the main screen, with menu bar). \"color\" is the clut index (scalar or [r g b] "
    "triplet or [r g b a] quadruple) that you want to poke into each pixel; default color is white.\n\n"
    "If supplied, \"rect\" must contain at least one pixel. \"rect\" is in screen coordinates "
    "(origin at upper left), and defaults to the whole screen. (In all cases, "
    "subsequent references to this new window will use its coordinates: origin at its "
    "upper left.). Please note that while providing a \"rect\" parameter to open a normal "
    "window instead of a fullscreen window is convenient for debugging, drawing performance, "
    "stimulus onset timing and onset timestamping may be impaired, so be careful.\n\n"
    "\"pixelSize\" sets the depth (in bits) of each pixel; default is to leave depth unchanged. "
    "You should usually not specify such a bit depth, the system knows what it is doing.\n\n"
    "\"numberOfBuffers\" is the number of buffers to use. Setting anything else than 2 will be only "
    "useful for development/debugging of PTB itself but will mess up any real experiment.\n\n"
    "\"stereomode\" Type of stereo display algorithm to use: 0 (default) means: Monoscopic viewing:\n"
    "1 means: Stereo output via OpenGL native quad-buffered stereo on any stereo hardware supports this.\n"
    "2 means: Left view compressed into top half, right view into bottom half of window for frame-doubling stereo.\n"
    "3 means left view compressed into bottom half, right view compressed into top half for frame-doubling stereo.\n"
    "4 and 5 allow split screen stereo display where the left view is shown in left half, the right view is shown "
    "in the right half of the display, e.g., for mirrorscope/haploscope setups, or dual-display stereo devices.\n"
    "A value of 5 does the opposite (cross-fusion), exchanges left and right eye view.\n"
    "Values of 6,7,8 and 9 enable Anaglyph stereo rendering of types left=Red, right=Green, vice versa and "
    "left=Red, right=Blue and vice versa.\n"
    "A value of 10 enables multi-window stereo: Open one window for left eye view, one for right eye view, "
    "treat both of them as one single stereo window.\n"
    "A value of 11 enables our own frame-sequential stereo mode for driving shutter glasses and similar devices "
    "on display hardware and operating systems which do not support frame-sequential stereo natively (like mode 1).\n"
    "A value of 12 enables stereo processing within separate streams of the imaging pipeline, followed by some custom "
    "display method for the end results of that separate stream processing. This is usually used for stereo output "
    "to special display devices like Virtual reality head sets, instead of output to a normal onscreen window or display "
    "monitor.\n"
    "See StereoDemo.m for examples of usage of the different stereo modes. See ImagingStereoDemo.m for more advanced "
    "usage on modern hardware.\n\n"
    "\"multisample\" This parameter, if provided and set to a value greater than zero, enables automatic "
    "hardware anti-aliasing of the display: For each pixel, 'multisample' color samples are computed and "
    "combined into a single output pixel color. Higher numbers provide better quality but consume more "
    "video memory and lead to a reduction in framerate due to the higher computational demand. The maximum "
    "number of samples is hardware dependent. Psychtoolbox will silently clamp the number to the maximum "
    "supported by your hardware if you ask for too much. On very old hardware, the value will be ignored. "
    "Read 'help AntiAliasing' for more in-depth information about multi-sampling.\n\n"
    "\"imagingmode\" This optional parameter enables PTB's internal image processing pipeline. The pipeline is "
    "off by default. Read 'help PsychImaging' for information about typical use and benefits of this feature.\n\n"
    "\"specialFlags\" This optional parameter enables some special window behaviours if the sum of certain "
    "flags is passed. A currently supported flag is the symbolic constant kPsychGUIWindow. It enables windows "
    "to behave more like regular GUI windows on your system. See 'help kPsychGUIWindow' for more info. The "
    "flag kPsychGUIWindowWMPositioned additionally leaves initial positioning of the GUI window to the window "
    "manager.\n\n"
    "\"clientRect\" This optional parameter allows to define a size of the onscreen windows drawing area "
    "that is different from the actual size of the windows framebuffer. If set, then the imaging pipeline "
    "is started and a virtual framebuffer of the size of \"clientRect\" is created. Your code will draw "
    "into that framebuffer. At display time, the content of this virtual framebuffer will get scaled to "
    "the size of the true onscreen window, a process known as panel-scaling or panel-fitting. This allows "
    "to decouple the size of a stimulus as drawn by your code from the actual resolution of the display "
    "device. The feature is mostly useful if you need to run the same presentation code on different setups "
    "with different native resolutions. See the 'help PsychImaging' section about 'UsePanelFitter' for more info.\n\n"
    "\"fbOverrideRect\" This optional parameter allows to override the true size of the onscreen windows framebuffer "
    "for the purpose of image processing operations with the imaging pipeline. While the true size of the windows "
    "framebuffer is defined by the standard \"rect\" parameter, internal processing will instead use the given "
    "override size. This usually only makes sense in combination with special output devices that live outside the "
    "regular windowing system of your computer, e.g., special Virtual reality displays.\n"
    "\n"
    "Opening or closing a window takes about one to three seconds, depending on the type of connected display. "
    "If your system has noisy timing or flaky graphics drivers it might take up to 15 seconds to open a window.\n"
    "COMPATIBILITY TO OS-9 PTB: If you absolutely need to run old code for the old MacOS-9 or Windows "
    "Psychtoolbox-2, you can switch into a compatibility mode by adding the command "
    "Screen('Preference', 'EmulateOldPTB', 1) at the very top of your script. This will restore "
    "Offscreen windows and WaitBlanking functionality, but at the same time disable most of the new "
    "features of the OpenGL Psychtoolbox. Please do not write new experiment code in the old style! "
    "Emulation mode may contain significant bugs, as it gets virtually no testing, so use with great caution!";
