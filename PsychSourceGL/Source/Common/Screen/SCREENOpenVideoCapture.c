  HISTORY:
  
  2/7/06	mk		Created. 
  12/23/07	mk		Extended to allow switching between capture engines on a per-device basis.
 
  DESCRIPTION:
  
  Open a video capture source (framegrabber, webcam, ...), create and initialize a corresponding capture object
  and return a handle to it to MATLAB space.
 
  On 32-Bit OS-X, video capture is implemented via Apples Sequence-Grabber API which is part of Quicktime.
  On all systems, the preferred video capture engine is GStreamer, except for 32-Bit OSX.
  On Linux and OS/X we support Firewire machine vision cameras that comply to the IIDC-1.x specification,
  via use of the open-source free software library libdc1394 V2. The library itself is most powerful and well
  tested/tuned for GNU/Linux systems, but also well working on OS/X. It has experimental limited support for
  MS-Windows as well, but we don't implement it for Windows yet.

static char useString[] = "videoPtr = Screen('OpenVideoCapture', windowPtr [, deviceIndex] [,roirectangle] [, pixeldepth] [, numbuffers] [, allowfallback] [, targetmoviename] [, recordingflags] [, captureEngineType]);";
static char synopsisString[] = 
"Try to open the video source 'deviceIndex' for video capture into onscreen window 'windowPtr' and "
"return a handle 'videoPtr' on success. If 'deviceIndex' is left out, it defaults to zero - use the "
"first capture device attached to your machine. 'roirectangle' if specified, defines the requested size "
"for captured images. The default is to return the maximum size image provided by the capture device. "
"A 'roirectangle' setting of [0 0 width height] will not define a region of interest, but instead request a "
"video capture resolution of width x height pixels, instead of the default maximum resolution. Settings "
"of [left top right bottom] will leave video capture at maximum resolution, but crop the images to the "
"rectangular subregion as defined by the given left, right, top and bottom borders. Such ROI's are "
"only applied to returned video images, not to recorded video by default. See the 'recordingflags' "
"settings below on how to adjust this behaviour to your needs.\n"
"The real ROI (region of interest) may differ from the requested one, depending on the capabilities of "
"your capture device. 'pixeldepth' if provided, asks for the number of layers that captured textures "
"should have: 1=Luminance image, 2=Luminance+Alpha image, 3=RGB image, 4=RGB+Alpha, 5=YCBCR, 6=I420 image. Default is "
"to take whatever the capture device provides by default. Different devices support different formats "
"so some of these settings may be ignored. Some combinations of video capture devices and graphics "
"cards may support a setting of 5=YCBCR encoding. If they do, then this is an especially efficient way "
"to handle color images, which may result in lower cpu load and higher framerates. A format of 6=YUV-I420 "
"should be supported by all modern graphics cards and may provide some performance benefits, but your mileage "
"may vary. If you need very fast color image capture, try formats 4, 5 and 6 and see which one gives the "
"best performance for your setup.\n"
"'numbuffers' if provided, specifies the number of internal "
"video buffers to use. It defaults to a value that is optimal for your specific hardware for common use. "
"'allowfallback' if set to 1, will allow Psychtoolbox to use a less efficient mode of operation for video "
"capture if your specific hardware or operating system setup doesn't allow to use the high-performance "
"mode. 'allowfallback' defaults to 1 = Allow fallback path.\n"
"'targetmoviename' If you provide a filename for this argument, PTB will record the captured video to the "
"specified  movie file on your filesystem. PTB will use a default video codec for encoding the "
"video stream. If you want to use a specific codec, you can extend the targetmoviename by a string of "
"format :CodecType=xxx , where xxx is the numeric type id or name of the codec. You can get a list of codecs "
"supported by your system by running PTB's recording engine at a verbosity level of 4 or higher.\n"
"However, please read 'help VideoRecording' for many more options for tweaking the video recording "
"process via the 'targetmoviename' parameter.\n"
"'recordingflags' specify the behaviour of harddisc- "
"recording: 0 (default) = Only record video. 2 = Record audio track as well. The value 1 (or 1+2) asks "
"PTB to first record into system memory, and only write the movie file after capture has been stopped. "
"This allows for higher capture framerates, but is limited in recording time by installed memory. Also, "
"this mode currently can sometimes cause hangs and crashes of PTB for unknown reasons, so better avoid!\n"
"A setting of 4 will only enable recording, but no return of captured data, i.e., just record to disk. "
"A setting of 8 will avoid some calls that are supposed to provide better realtime behaviour, but may "
"cause some problems with some video codecs when recording to disk. A setting of 16 will perform most "
"of the heavy work on a separate parallel background thread, utilizing multi-core machines better.\n"
"A setting of 32 will try to select the highest quality codec for texture creation from captured video, "
"instead of the normal quality codec. A setting of 64 will return capture timestamps in the time base of "
"the video engine (e.g., elapsed time since start of capture, or recording time in movie), instead of "
"the default time base, which is regular GetSecs() time.\n"
"A setting of 128 will force use of a videorate converter in pure live capture mode. By default the "
"videorate converter is only used if video recording is active. The converter makes sure that video is "
"recorded (or delivered) at exactly the requested capture framerate, even if the system isn't really "
"capable of maintaining that framerate: If the video source (camera) delivers frames at a too low "
"framerate, the converter will insert duplicated frames to boost up effective framerate. If the source "
"delivers more frames than the engine can handle (e.g., system overload or video encoding too slow) "
"the converter will drop frames to reduce effective framerate. Slight fluctuations are compensated by "
"adjusting the capture timestamps. This mechanism guarantees a constant framerate in recorded video "
"as well as the best possible audio-video sync and smoothness of video, given system constraints. "
"The downside may be that the recorded content and returned timestamps don't reflect the true timing "
"of capture, but a beautified version. In pure live capture, rate conversion is off by default to avoid "
"such potential confounds in the timestamps. Choose this options carefully.\n"
"A setting of 256 in combined video live capture and video recording mode will restrict video framerate "
"conversion to the recorded videostream, but provide mostly untampered true timing to the live capture. "
"By default, framerate conversion applies to recording and live feedback if video recording is enabled.\n"
"A setting of 512 requests that ROI's as defined by the 'roirectangle' parameter get also applied to recorded video. "
"Without this setting, ROI's only apply to live video as returned by Screen('GetCapturedImage',...);\n"
"A setting of 1024 disables application of ROI's to live video as returned by Screen('GetCapturedImage',...);\n"
"A setting of 2048 requests immediate conversion of video textures into a format suitable as offscreen window, "
"for use with Screen('TransformTexture') or for drawing with custom user provided GLSL shaders. Normally this "
"happens automatically on first use, asking for it explicitely may have performance or convenience benefits.\n"
"\n"
"'captureEngineType' This optional parameter allows selection of the video capture engine to use for this "
"video source. Allowable values are currently 0, 1 and 3. Zero selects Apples Quicktime Sequence-Grabber API "
"as capture engine, which is only supported on MacOS/X with 32-Bit Matlab or 32-Bit Octave. The Quicktime "
"engine allows movie recording and sound recording as well (see above). "
"A value of 1 selects Firewire video capture via the free software library libdc1394-V2. "
"That engine only supports high performance machine vision cameras that are compliant with the "
"IIDC-1.x standard and are connected via a Firewire (IEEE-1394) bus system. Use of the engine with such "
"cams allows for much higher flexibility and performance than use of video capture via Quicktime, "
"however, video recording to harddisk or sound recording isn't yet supported with firewire capture, ie., "
"the 'targetmoviename' is simply ignored. The firewire capture engine is supported on Linux, MacOS/X and "
"- maybe at some point in the future, with quite a few limitations and bugs - on Windows.\n\n"
"A value of 3 selects the GStreamer video capture engine. This engine will be supported on all operating systems "
"and will allow for video and sound recording of captured video and audio streams. Currently "
"it is not yet implemented on 32-Bit Mac OS/X. Type 'help GStreamer' for installation and "
"setup instructions for the required GStreamer runtime libraries.\n\n"
"If you don't specify 'captureEngineType', the global "
"setting from Screen('Preference', 'DefaultVideoCaptureEngine') will be used. If you don't specify that either "
"then engine selection will default to Quicktime for MacOS/X and GStreamer on Linux and MS-Windows.\n\n"
"To summarize: \n"
"Quicktime engine: Supports all cameras/video sources supported by your operating system, allows for video- and "
"audio recording as well. On many setups, only one camera can be used at a time and the 'deviceIndex' parameter "
"is ignored -- the default source is always chosen. Latency, max framerate and reliability is ok, but not stellar.\n"
"GStreamer: Is the engine of choice for all operating systems and most applications.\n"
"Firewire engine: Supports only Firewire machine vision cameras, but allows free selection among all connected "
"cameras, simultaneous operation of many cameras, low latency, high framerates and reliability, precise timestamping "
"and low level access to many special features of such cameras, e.g., gain-, shutter-, exposure-, trigger controls etc.\n";
