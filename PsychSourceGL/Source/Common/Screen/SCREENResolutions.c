    DESCRIPTION:

    Contains the subfunctions 'ConfigureDisplay', 'Resolutions' and 'Resolution'.
    Enumerates and returns all supported display modes - combinations of resolution, refresh rate and color depth.
    Allows to query and set display mode.

/* As of macOS 10.12.4, brightness set by public IOKit API is
 overridden by CoreDisplay's brightness (to support Night Shift). In
 addition, using CoreDisplay to get brightness supports additional
 display types, e.g. the 2015 iMac's internal display.
 The below functions in CoreDisplay seem to work to adjust the
 "user" brightness (like dragging the slider in System Preferences
 or using function keys).  The symbols below are listed in the .tbd
 file in CoreDisplay.framework so it is at least more "public" than
 a symbol in a private framework, though there are no public headers
 distributed for this framework. */

     - There's no way to tell if setting the brightness was successful
     - There's no way to tell if a brightness of 1 means that the
     brightness is actually 1, or if there's no adjustable brightness
     - Brightness changes aren't reflected in System Preferences
     immediately
     Fixing these means using the private DisplayServices.framework.  Be
