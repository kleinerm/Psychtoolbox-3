"the window due to Screen('AsyncFlipBegin') is not allowed. Finalize such flips first. "
"Readback of other onscreen or offscreen windows or textures is possible during async "
"flip, but discouraged because it will have a significant impact on performance.\n\n"
"The returned imageArray by default has three layers, i.e. it is an RGB image.\n\n"
"\"windowPtr\" is the handle of the onscreen window, offscreen window or texture whose image "
"should be returned.\n\n"
"\"rect\" is the rectangular subregion to copy, and its default is the whole window. "
"The specified image subregion must be fully contained inside the window, otherwise this "
"function will abort with an error.\n\n"
"Matlab/Octave will complain if you try to do math on a uint8 array, so you may need "
"to use DOUBLE to convert it, e.g. imageArray/255 will produce an error, but "
"double(imageArray)/255 is ok. Also see Screen 'PutImage' and 'CopyWindow'.\n\n"
"\"bufferName\" is a string specifying the buffer from which to copy the image: "
"The 'bufferName' argument is meaningless for offscreen windows and textures and "
"will be silently ignored. For onscreen windows, it defaults to 'frontBuffer', i.e., "
"it returns the image that is sent through the video output of your graphics card to "
"your display device at that moment. On OpenGL-ES graphics hardware, all 'bufferName' "
"settings except 'backBuffer' or 'drawBuffer' will be ignored and image data is always "
"read from either the 'drawBuffer' or the 'backBuffer'. This is an unavoidable system "
"limitation of such embedded hardware.\n"
"If frame-sequential stereo mode is enabled, 'frontLeftBuffer' returns the image generated "
"for the left eye, 'frontRightBuffer' returns the right-eye view. If double-buffering "
"is enabled, you can also return the 'backBuffer', i.e. what your subject will see after "
"the next Screen('Flip') command, and for frame-sequential stereo also 'backLeftBuffer' "
"and 'backRightBuffer' respectively. Both the 'frontBuffer' and 'backBuffer' images and "
"their stereo variants will return the final images as they are really encoded in the system "
"framebuffer and sent to the video outputs of your graphics hardware. These images are the "
"result of any post-processing done by the Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline, e.g., Retina display "
"processing, geometric transformations, color transformations, certain types of gamma correction, "
"stereo post-processing, or special pixel encoding for devices like Bits# or Datapixx. As such "
"they may differ in size and format from what you have drawn into the onscreen window.\n"
"'aux0Buffer' - 'aux3Buffer' returns the content of OpenGL AUX buffers 0 to 3. Only query "
"the AUX buffers if you know what you are doing, otherwise your script will crash. This is "
"mostly meant for internal debugging of PTB.\n"
"If the imaging pipeline is enabled, you can also return the content of the unprocessed "
"backbuffer, ie. before processing by the pipeline, by requesting 'drawBuffer'.\n"
"If the imaging pipeline is enabled, querying the 'backBuffer' will only give you up to date "
"results after you called Screen('Flip') or Screen('AsyncFlipBegin') or Screen('DrawingFinished'), "
"otherwise you may encounter stale results. If our own homegrown frame-sequential stereo mode "
"is in use, querying the 'backLeftBuffer' and 'backRightBuffer' is well defined, after a Screen('Flip') "
"or Screen('DrawingFinished'), but querying the 'frontLeftBuffer' or 'frontRightBuffer' or "
"'frontBuffer' will result in an assignment of left- and right- stereo images that is mostly "
"based on chance, e.g., you may get accidentally swapped left- and rightBuffer images!\n\n"
"\"floatprecision\" If you set this optional flag to 1, the image data will be returned "
"as a double precision matrix instead of a uint8 matrix. Please note that normal image "
"data will be returned in the normalized range 0.0 to 1.0 instead of 0 - 255. Floating "
"point readback is only beneficial when reading back floating point precision textures, "
"offscreen windows or the framebuffer when the imaging pipeline is active and HDR mode "
"is selected (ie. more than 8bpc framebuffer). On OpenGL-ES hardware, only floating point "
"framebuffers do support 'floatprecision' readback.\n"
"\"nrchannels\" Number of color channels to return. By default, 3 channels (RGB) are "
"returned. Specify 1 for Red/Luminance only, 2 for Red+Green or Luminance+Alpha, 3 for "
"RGB and 4 for RGBA. A setting of 2 is not supported on OpenGL-ES hardware. \n\n";
