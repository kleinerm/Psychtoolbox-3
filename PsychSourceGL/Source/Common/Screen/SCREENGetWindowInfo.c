  PLATFORMS:    All

  HISTORY:
  06/03/07      mk  Created.

  DESCRIPTION:

  Returns all kind of misc information about a specific window in a struct.
  This is a catch-all for information that's not of too much interest for regular
  users, but useful for Psychtoolbox helper functions (M-Files).

  NOTES:

  Be careful with length of struct field names! Only names up to 31 characters are
  supported by Matlab 5.x (and maybe 6.x -- untested). Larger names cause matching
  failure!
