  DESCRIPTION:
  
  Open a named movie file from the filesystem, create and initialize a corresponding movie object
  and return a handle to it to MATLAB space.
 
  On OS-X and Windows, all movie/multimedia handling functions are implemented via the Apple Quicktime API,
  version 7 or later. On Linux we use GStreamer: We need at least the gstreamer core library and base plugin
  set installed for it to work, but more plugins never hurt.

		"Try to open the multimediafile 'moviefile' for playback in onscreen window 'windowPtr' and "
        "return a handle 'moviePtr' on success.\nOn OS-X and Windows, media files are handled by use of "
        "Apples Quicktime-7 API. On Linux, and optionally Windows, the GStreamer multimedia framework is used. "
        "The following movie properties are optionally returned: 'duration' Total duration of movie in seconds. "
        "'fps' Video playback framerate, assuming a linear spacing of videoframes in time. There may "
        "exist exotic movie formats which don't have this linear spacing. In that case, 'fps' would "
        "return bogus values and the check for skipped frames would report bogus values as well. "
        "'width' Width of the images contained in the movie. 'height' Height of the images.\n"
        "'count' Total number of videoframes in the movie. Determined by counting, so querying 'count' "
        "can significantly increase the execution time of this command.\n"
		"'aspectRatio' Pixel aspect ratio of pixels in the video frames. Typically 1.0 for square pixels. "
		"Aspect ratio is only detected with the GStreamer playback engine. Quicktime always returns 1.0.\n"
        "If you want to play multiple movies in succession with lowest possible delay inbetween the movies "
        "then you can ask PTB to load a movie in the background while another movie is still playing: "
        "Call this function with the 'async' flag set to 1. This will initiate the background load operation. "
        "After some sufficient time has passed, you can call the 'OpenMovie' function again, this time with "
        "the 'async' flag set to zero. Now the function will return a valid movie handle for playback. Background "
        "loading of movies currently does only work well with movies that don't have sound, unless you use Linux.\n"
        "If you use the GStreamer playback engine and all your movies have exactly the same format and only differ "
        "in duration and content, but not in image size, color depth or format, or fps, then you can also use "
        "an aync setting of 2 and provide the 'moviePtr' handle of an already opened movie in the 'preloadSecs' "
        "parameter. This will queue the movie 'moviefile' as a successor to the currently playing moviefile in "
        "'moviePtr'. Queuing movies this way is more efficient than async flag setting 1, although also more "
        "restricted.\n"
		"If the 'async' flag also contains the number 4 or is equal to 4, then movie playback will not automatically "
		"drop video frames to preserve audio-video sync in case fetching and display of video frames by your script "
		"is delayed or too slow. This has the disadvantage that you'll need to take care of audio-video sync and framerate "
		"control yourself by proper comparison of movie presentation timestamps and GetSecs or Screen('Flip') timestamps. "
		"The advantage is, that after start of playback the playback engine can internally predecode and buffer up to "
		"'preloadSecs' seconds worth of video and audio data. This may allow complex movies to play more smoothly or "
		"at higher framerates. This option is only supported with the GStreamer playback engine.\n"
		"'preloadSecs' This optional parameter allows to ask Screen() to load at least the first 'preloadSecs' "
		"seconds of the movie into system RAM. By default, with Quicktime playback, the first second of the "
		"movie file is loaded into RAM. This potentially allows for more stutter-free playback, but your mileage "
		"may vary, depending on movie format, storage medium and lots of other factors. In most cases, the default "
		"setting is perfectly sufficient. The special setting -1 means: Load whole movie into RAM. Caution: Long "
		"movies may cause your system to run low on memory and have disastrous effects on playback performance! "
		"Also, the exact type of buffering applied depends a lot on the movie playback engine and movie format, ie., "
		"what the parameter exactly does can be different for Quicktime vs. GStreamer, but it always affects the "
		"buffering behaviour and capacity of buffering in some meaningful way.\n"
		"'specialFlags1' Optional flags, numbers to be added together: 1 = Use YUV video decoding instead of RGBA, if "
		"supported by movie codec and GPU - May be more efficient. 2 = Don't decode and use sound - May be more efficient. "
		"On Linux you may need to specify a setting of 2 if you try to use movie playback at the same time as "
		"PsychPortAudio sound output, otherwise movie playback may hang. A flag of 4 will draw motion vectors on top "
        "of decoded video frames, for debugging or entertainment. A flag of 8 will ask the video decoder to skip all "
        "B-Frames during decoding to reduce processor load on very slow machines. Not all codecs may support flags 4 or "
        "8, in which case these flags are silently ignored. A flag of 16 asks Screen to convert all video textures "
        "immediately into a format which makes them useable as offscreen windows, and for the Screen('TransformTexture') "
        "function as well as for drawing them with your own custom GLSL shaders. Normally this conversion would be "
        "deferred until needed, ie. it would get skipped if you would just draw the texture regularly. If you know "
        "already that you want to use the texture with one of the given functions, manually triggering the conversion "
        "via this flag may be a bit more efficient - or convenient if you want to use your own GLSL shaders.\n"
        "'pixelFormat' optional argument specifying the pixel format of decoded video frames. Not all possible valid "
        "values are supported by all video codecs, graphics cards and operating systems. If an unsupported format is "
        "requested, Screen() will try to choose the closest matching format that meets or exceeds the specified format, "
        "at a performance or efficiency penalty. If no sufficiently close match is possible without severely degraded "
        "performance or other restrictions, the function will abort with an error. The following formats are supported "
        "on some setups: 1 = Luminance/Greyscale image, 2 = Luminance+Alpha, 3 = RGB 8 bit per channel, 4 = RGBA8, "
        "5 = YUV 4:2:2 packed pixel format on some graphics hardware, 6 = YUV-I420 planar format, using GLSL shaders "
        "for color space conversion on suitable graphics cards. 7 or 8 = Y8-Y800 planar format, using GLSL shaders. "
        "The always supported default is '4' == RGBA8 format. "
        "A setting of 6 (for color) or 7/8 (for grayscale) for selection of YUV-I420/Y8-Y800 format, as supported by at "
        "least the H264 and HuffYUV video codecs on any GPU with "
        "shader support, can be especially efficient for fast playback of high resolution video. As this format uses "
        "shaders for post-processing, it should be fast for texture drawing, but can incur significant overhead if you "
        "try to draw into a texture of this format, or try to post-process it via Screen('TransformTexture'). If you try "
        "to attach your own shaders to such a texture during Screen('DrawTexture'), you will need to implement color "
        "conversion yourself in your shaders, as your shaders would override Screen's builtin color conversion shader.\n"
        "CAUTION: On 32-Bit OS/X, some movie files, e.g., MPEG-1 movies sometimes cause Matlab to hang. This seems to be "
        "a bad interaction between parts of Apples Quicktime toolkit and Matlabs Java Virtual Machine (JVM). "
        "If you experience stability problems, please start Matlab with JVM and desktop disabled, e.g., "
        "with the command: 'matlab -nojvm'. An example command sequence in a terminal window could be: "
        "/Applications/MATLAB701/bin/matlab -nojvm ";

        "framework is used for movie writing. GStreamer is generally more advanced and offers more functionality. "

        "See 'Screen AddAudioBufferToMovie?' on how to add audio tracks to movies via GStreamer.\n"

		"Movie creation is a 3 step procedure:\n"
		"1. Create a movie and define encoding options via 'CreateMovie'.\n"
		"2. Add video and audio data to the movie via calls to 'AddFrameToMovie' et al.\n"
		"3. Finalize and close the movie via a call to 'FinalizeMovie'.\n\n"
		"All following parameters are optional and have reasonable defaults:\n\n"
		"'width' Width of movie video frames in pixels. Defaults to width of window 'windowPtr'.\n"
		"'height' Height of movie video frames in pixels. Defaults to height of window 'windowPtr'.\n"
		"'frameRate' Playback framerate of movie. Defaults to 30 fps. Technically this is not the "
		"playback framerate but the granularity in 1/frameRate seconds with which the duration of "
		"a single movie frame can be specified. When you call 'AddFrameToMovie', there's an optional "
		"parameter 'frameDuration' which defaults to one. The parameter defines the display duration "
		"of that frame as the fraction 'frameDuration' / 'frameRate' seconds, so 'frameRate' defines "
		"the denominator of that term. However, for a default 'frameDuration' of one, this is equivalent "
		"to the 'frameRate' of the movie, at least if you leave everything at defaults.\n\n"
		"'movieoptions' a textstring which allows to define additional parameters via keyword=parm pairs. "

        "See 'help VideoRecording' for supported options and tips.\n"
		"Keywords unknown to a certain implementation or codec will be silently ignored:\n"
		"EncodingQuality=x Set encoding quality to value x, in the range 0.0 for lowest movie quality to "
		"1.0 for highest quality. Default is 0.5 = normal quality. 1.0 usually provides lossless encoding.\n"
        "On systems with Quicktime movie writing, codecs can be selected by FOURCC codes. This is not supported "
        "on GStreamer setups for now:\n"
		"CodecFOURCCId=id FOURCC id. The FOURCC of a desired video codec as a number. Defaults to H.264 codec.\n"
		"Choice of codec and quality defines a tradeoff between filesize, quality, processing demand and speed, "
		"as well as on which target devices you'll be able to play your movie.\n"
		"CodecFOURCC=xxxx FOURCC as a four character text string instead of a number.\n"
