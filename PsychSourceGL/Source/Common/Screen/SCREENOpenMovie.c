static char synopsisString[] = 
        "Try to open the multimediafile 'moviefile' for playback in onscreen window 'windowPtr' and "
        "return a handle 'moviePtr' on success.\n"
        "This function requires the GStreamer multi-media framework to be installed on your system.\n"
        "The following movie properties are optionally returned: 'duration' Total duration of movie in seconds. "
        "'fps' Video playback framerate, assuming a linear spacing of videoframes in time. There may "
        "exist exotic movie formats which don't have this linear spacing. In that case, 'fps' would "
        "return bogus values and the check for skipped frames would report bogus values as well. "
        "'width' Width of the images contained in the movie. 'height' Height of the images.\n"
        "'count' Total number of videoframes in the movie. Determined by counting, so querying 'count' "
        "can significantly increase the execution time of this command.\n"
        "'aspectRatio' Pixel aspect ratio of pixels in the video frames. Typically 1.0 for square pixels.\n"
        "If you want to play multiple movies in succession with lowest possible delay inbetween the movies "
        "then you can ask PTB to load a movie in the background while another movie is still playing: "
        "Call this function with the 'async' flag set to 1. This will initiate the background load operation. "
        "After some sufficient time has passed, you can call the 'OpenMovie' function again, this time with "
        "the 'async' flag set to zero. Now the function will return a valid movie handle for playback.\n"
        "If all your movies have exactly the same format and only differ "
        "in duration and content, but not in image size, color depth, encoding format, or fps, then you can also use "
        "an aync setting of 2 and provide the 'moviePtr' handle of an already opened movie in the 'preloadSecs' "
        "parameter. This will queue the movie 'moviefile' as a successor to the currently playing moviefile in "
        "'moviePtr'. Queuing movies this way is more efficient than async flag setting 1, although also more "
        "restricted.\n"
        "If the 'async' flag also contains the number 4 or is equal to 4, then movie playback will not automatically "
        "drop video frames to preserve audio-video sync in case fetching and display of video frames by your script "
        "is delayed or too slow. This has the disadvantage that you'll need to take care of audio-video sync and framerate "
        "control yourself by proper comparison of movie presentation timestamps and GetSecs or Screen('Flip') timestamps. "
        "The advantage is, that after start of playback the playback engine can internally predecode and buffer up to "
        "'preloadSecs' seconds worth of video and audio data. This may allow complex movies to play more smoothly or "
        "at higher framerates.\n"
        "'preloadSecs' This optional parameter allows to ask Screen() to buffer at least up to 'preloadSecs' "
        "seconds of the movie. This potentially allows for more stutter-free playback, but your mileage "
        "may vary, depending on movie format, storage medium and lots of other factors. In most cases, the default "
        "setting is perfectly sufficient. The special setting -1 means: Try to buffer the whole movie. Caution: Long "
        "movies may cause your system to run low on memory or disc space and have disastrous effects on playback performance! "
        "Also, the exact type of buffering applied depends a lot on the movie playback engine and movie format, "
        "but it usually affects the buffering behaviour and capacity of buffering in some meaningful way.\n"
        "'specialFlags1' Optional flags, numbers to be added together: 1 = Use YUV video decoding instead of RGBA, if "
        "supported by movie codec and GPU - May be more efficient. 2 = Don't decode and use sound - May be more efficient. "
        "On Linux you may need to specify a setting of 2 if you try to use movie playback at the same time as "
        "PsychPortAudio sound output, otherwise movie playback may hang. A flag of 4 will draw motion vectors on top "
        "of decoded video frames, for debugging or entertainment. A flag of 8 will ask the video decoder to skip all "
        "B-Frames during decoding to reduce processor load on very slow machines. Not all codecs may support flags 4 or "
        "8, in which case these flags are silently ignored. A flag of 16 asks Screen to convert all video textures "
        "immediately into a format which makes them useable as offscreen windows, and for the Screen('TransformTexture') "
        "function as well as for drawing them with your own custom GLSL shaders. Normally this conversion would be "
        "deferred until needed, ie. it would get skipped if you would just draw the texture regularly. If you know "
        "already that you want to use the texture with one of the given functions, manually triggering the conversion "
        "via this flag may be a bit more efficient - or convenient if you want to use your own GLSL shaders.\n"
        "The optional flags 32, 64 and 128 influence how looped playback is performed if usercode requests such "
        "repetitive playback via Screen('PlayMovie', ...) with the 'loop' flag set to one. Different strategies exist "
        "to handle different quirks with some movie file formats and encodings and some versions of GStreamer: A flag "
        "of 32 requests looped playback via gapless reloading of the movie instead of rewinding it to the start. A flag "
        "of 64 uses so called segment seeks for rewinding, a flag of 128 asks to flush the video pipeline during rewinding. "
        "Your mileage with these looping strategies will differ, but usually the default settings are good enough for most "
        "purposes.\n"
        "A 'specialFlags1' setting of 256 will prevent automatic deinterlacing of video. This is useful to prevent some "
        "internal color data conversions, e.g., of pure grayscale data, which can cause slightly lossy decoding of lossless "
        "video data.\n"
        "A 'specialFlags1' setting of 512 marks the movie as encoded in Psychtoolbox's own proprietary 16 bpc high precision "
        "format. Grayscale movies in this format can be created by specifying the keyword UsePTB16BPC in Screen('CreateMovie') "
        "or in the firewire videocapture engine as part of the codec spec string. RGB movies can also get created this way. "
        "Encoding or decoding of such 16 bpc movies with a channel count other than 1 or 3 for gray or RGB is not supported.\n"
        "A 'specialFlags1' setting of 1024 tells the movie playback that this movies video frames are encoded as raw Bayer "
        "sensor data and that they should get converted to RGB images during playback via software Bayer filtering. You must "
        "set the 'pixelFormat' parameter to 1 for this to work. You can choose the Bayer filtering method via 'DebayerMethod' "
        "setting and the color sensor filter pattern via 'OverrideBayerPattern' setting in Screen('SetVideoCaptureParameter', -1, ...). "
        "By default, fast nearest neighbour debayering with an assumed sensor image layout of RGGB is performed.\n"
        "'pixelFormat' optional argument specifying the pixel format of decoded video frames. Not all possible valid "
        "values are supported by all video codecs, graphics cards and operating systems. If an unsupported format is "
        "requested, Screen() will try to choose the closest matching format that meets or exceeds the specified format, "
        "at a performance or efficiency penalty. If no sufficiently close match is possible without severely degraded "
        "performance or other restrictions, the function will abort with an error. The following formats are supported "
        "on some setups: 1 = Luminance/Greyscale image, 2 = Luminance+Alpha, 3 = RGB 8 bit per channel, 4 = RGBA8, "
        "5 = YUV 4:2:2 packed pixel format on some graphics hardware, 6 = YUV-I420 planar format, using GLSL shaders "
        "for color space conversion on suitable graphics cards. 7 or 8 = Y8-Y800 planar format, using GLSL shaders, "
        "9 = 16 bit Luminance, 10 = 16 bpc RGBA image."
        "The always supported default is '4' == RGBA8 format. "
        "A setting of 6 (for color) or 7/8 (for grayscale) for selection of YUV-I420/Y8-Y800 format, as supported by at "
        "least the H264 and HuffYUV video codecs on any GPU with "
        "shader support, can be especially efficient for fast playback of high resolution video. As this format uses "
        "shaders for post-processing, it should be fast for texture drawing, but can incur significant overhead if you "
        "try to draw into a texture of this format, or try to post-process it via Screen('TransformTexture'). If you try "
        "to attach your own shaders to such a texture during Screen('DrawTexture'), you will need to implement color "
        "conversion yourself in your shaders, as your shaders would override Screen's builtin color conversion shader.\n"
        "'maxNumberThreads' Optional parameter which allows to set the maximum number of parallel processing threads "
        "that should be used by multi-threaded video codecs to decode the movie. The parameter has no effect on single "
        "threaded codecs and default behaviour is to let the codec do whatever it wants. A setting of zero tells the "
        "codec to use multi-threaded decoding with a number of threads that is auto-selected to be optimal for your given "
        "computer. A number n greater zero asks the codec to use at most n threads for decoding. The most safe choice is "
        "to not specify this parameter - this should work even with problematic movie formats. If you need higher playback "
        "performance, e.g., for high resolution video or high framerate playback, you should set the parameter to zero to "
        "allow the optimal choice to the video codec. This should work flawlessly with well encoded high quality movie files "
        "and can provide a significant performance boost on multi-core computers. Specify a discrete non-zero number of threads "
        "if you want to benefit from multi-core decoding but want to prevent movie playback from using up all available computation "
        "power, e.g., because you want to run some other timing-sensitive tasks in parallel and want to make sure to leave some processor "
        "cores dedicated to them.\n"
        "'movieOptions' Optional text string which encodes additional options for playback of the movie. Parameters are "
        "keyword=value pairs, separated by three colons ::: if there are multiple parameters. Currently supported keywords:\n"
        "AudioSink=GStreamerSinkSpec -- GStreamerSinkSpec is a GStreamer gst-launch line style specification for a audio sink "
        "plugin and its parameters. This allows to customize where the audio of a movie is sent during playback and with which "
        "parameters. By default, the autoaudiosink plugin is used, which automatically chooses audio output and parameters, based "
        "on your system and user settings. Most often this is what you want. Sometimes you may want to have more control over "
        "outputs, e.g., if your system has multiple sound cards installed and you want to route audio output to a specific "
        "card and output connector. Example use of the parameter: 'AudioSink=pulseaudiosink device=MyCardsOutput1' would use the "
        "Linux pulseaudiosink plugin to send sound data to the output named 'MyCardsOutput1' via the PulseAudio sound server commonly "
        "used on Linux desktop systems.\n"
        "If you set a Screen() verbosity level of 4 or higher, Screen() will print out the actually used audio output at the end "
        "of movie playback on operating systems which support this. This can help debugging issues with audio routing if you don't hear sound.\n";

        "See 'Screen AddAudioBufferToMovie?' on how to add audio tracks to movies.\n"
        "\n"
		"Movie creation is a 3 step procedure:\n"
		"1. Create a movie and define encoding options via 'CreateMovie'.\n"
		"2. Add video and audio data to the movie via calls to 'AddFrameToMovie' et al.\n"
		"3. Finalize and close the movie via a call to 'FinalizeMovie'.\n\n"
		"All following parameters are optional and have reasonable defaults:\n\n"
		"'width' Width of movie video frames in pixels. Defaults to width of window 'windowPtr'.\n"
		"'height' Height of movie video frames in pixels. Defaults to height of window 'windowPtr'.\n"
		"'frameRate' Playback framerate of movie. Defaults to 30 fps. Technically this is not the "
		"playback framerate but the granularity in 1/frameRate seconds with which the duration of "
		"a single movie frame can be specified. When you call 'AddFrameToMovie', there's an optional "
		"parameter 'frameDuration' which defaults to one. The parameter defines the display duration "
		"of that frame as the fraction 'frameDuration' / 'frameRate' seconds, so 'frameRate' defines "
		"the denominator of that term. However, for a default 'frameDuration' of one, this is equivalent "
		"to the 'frameRate' of the movie, at least if you leave everything at defaults.\n\n"
		"'movieoptions' a textstring which allows to define additional parameters via keyword=parm pairs. "
        "For GStreamer movie writing, you can provide the same options as for GStreamer video recording. "
        "See 'help VideoRecording' for supported options and tips.\n"
		"Keywords unknown to a certain implementation or codec will be silently ignored:\n"
		"EncodingQuality=x Set encoding quality to value x, in the range 0.0 for lowest movie quality to "
		"1.0 for highest quality. Default is 0.5 = normal quality. 1.0 often provides near-lossless encoding.\n"
        "'numChannels' Optional number of image channels to encode: Can be 1, 3 or 4 on OpenGL graphics hardware, "
        "and 3 or 4 on OpenGL-ES hardware. 1 = Red/Grayscale channel only, 3 = RGB, 4 = RGBA. Please note that not "
        "all video codecs can encode pure 1 channel data or RGBA data, ie. an alpha channel. If an unsuitable codec "
        "is selected, movie writing may fail, or unsupported channels (e.g., the alpha channel) may get silently "
        "discarded. It could also happen that a codec which doesn't support 1 channel storage will replicate "
        "the Red/Grayscale data into all three RGB channels, leading to no data loss but increased movie file size. "
        "Default is to request RGBA 4 channel data from the system, encoding to RGBA or RGB, depending on codec.\n"
        "'bitdepth' Optional color/intensity resolution of each channel: Default is 8 bpc, for 8 bit per component "
        "storage. OpenGL graphics hardware, but not OpenGL-ES, also supports 16 bpc image readback. However, not all "
        "codecs can encode with > 8 bpc color/luminance precision, so encoding with 16 bpc may fail or silently reduce "
        "precision to less bits, possibly 8 bpc or less. If you specify the special keyword UsePTB16BPC in 'movieoptions', "
        "then PTB will use its own proprietary 16 bpc format for 1 or 3 channel mode. This format can only be read by "
        "PTB's own movie playback functions, not by other software.\n"
        "In general, embedded OpenGL-ES graphics hardware is more restricted in the type of image data it can return. "
        "Most video codecs are lossy codecs. They will intentionally throw away color or spatial precision of encoded "
        "video to reduce video file size or network bandwidth, often in a way that is not easily perceptible to the "
        "naked eye. If you require high fidelity, make sure to double-check your results for a given codec + parameter "
        "setup, e.g., via encoding + decoding the movie and checking the original data against decoded data.\n"
