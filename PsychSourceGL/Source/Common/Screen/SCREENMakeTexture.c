"Convert the 2D or 3D matrix 'imageMatrix' into an OpenGL texture and return an index which may be passed to 'DrawTexture' to specify the texture.\n"
"In the OpenGL Psychtoolbox textures replace offscreen windows for fast drawing of images during animation.\n"
"The imageMatrix argument may consist of one monochrome plane (Luminance), LA planes, RGB planes, or RGBA planes where "
"A is alpha, the transparency of a pixel. Alpha values typically range between zero (=fully transparent) and 255 (=fully opaque).\n"
"The Screen('ColorRange') command affects the range of expected input values in 'imageMatrix' matrices of double precision type, "
"as does the optional 'floatprecision' flag discussed below. If the parent window 'WindowIndex' is a HDR display window, then "
"by default floating point textures will be created, and uint8 image matrices will be remapped to a suitable subset of the HDR "
"color range, so that they fit in with real HDR color range images.\n"
"You need to enable Alpha-Blending via Screen('BlendFunction',...) for the transparency values to have an effect.\n"
"The argument 'optimizeForDrawAngle' if provided, asks Psychtoolbox to optimize the texture for especially fast "
"drawing at the specified rotation angle. The default is 0 == Optimize for upright drawing. If 'specialFlags' is set "
"to 1 and the width and height of the imageMatrix are powers of two (e.g., 64 x 64, 256 x 256, 512 x 512, ...), or "
"your graphics card supports so called non-power-of-two textures, then the texture is created as an OpenGL texture "
"of type GL_TEXTURE_2D. Otherwise Psychtoolbox will try to "
"pick the most optimal format for fast drawing and low memory consumption. GL_TEXTURE_2D textures are especially useful "
"for animation of drifting gratings, for simple use with the OpenGL 3D graphics functions and for blurring. Use of "
"GL_TEXTURE_2D textures is currently not automatically compatible with use of specialFlags settings 2 or 4.\n"
"If 'specialFlags' is set to 2 then PTB will try to use its own high quality texture filtering algorithm for drawing "
"of bilinearly filtered textures instead of the hardwares built-in method. This only works on modern hardware with "
"fragment shader support and is slower than using the hardwares built in filtering, but it may provide higher precision "
"on some hardware. PTB automatically enables its own filter algorithm when used with floating point "
"textures or when Screen('ColorRange') is used to enable unclamped color processing: PTB will check if your hardware "
"is capable of unrestricted high precision color processing in that case. If your hardware can't guarantee high precision, "
"PTB will enable its own shader-based workarounds to provide higher precision at the cost of lower speed. \n"
"If 'specialFlags' is set to 4 then PTB tries to use an especially fast method of texture creation. This method can be "
"at least an order of magnitude faster on some systems. However, it only works on modern GPUs, only for certain maximum "
"image sizes, and with some restrictions, e.g., scrolling of textures or high-precision filtering may not work at all or "
"as well. Your mileage may vary, so only use this flag if you need extra speed and after verifying your stimuli still look "
"correct. The biggest speedup is expected for creation of standard 8 bit integer textures from uint8 input matrices, "
"e.g., images from imread(), but also for 8 bit integer Luminance+Alpha and RGB textures from double format input matrices.\n"
"A 'specialFlags' == 8 will prevent automatic mipmap-generation for GL_TEXTURE_2D textures.\n"
"A 'specialFlags' == 32 setting will prevent automatic closing of the texture if Screen('Close'); is called. Only "
"Screen('Close', textureIndex); would close the texture.\n"
"'floatprecision' defines the precision with which the texture should be stored and processed. If omitted, the default value "
"in normal display mode is zero, which asks to store textures with 8 bit per color component precision in unsigned normalized "
"(unorm) color range, a suitable format for standard images read via imread() and displayed on normal display devices. If the "
"onscreen or parent window 'WindowIndex' is a HDR (High Dynamic Range) window displayed on a HDR capable display device, then "
"'floatprecision' defaults to 2 instead of 0, to accomodate the need for high image color precision and the larger value range "
"in HDR mode. A non-zero value will store the textures color component values as floating point precision numbers, useful "
"for complex blending operations and calculations on the textures, and for processing and display of high precision or high dynamic range "
"image textures, either on a LDR display via tone-mapping, or on a HDR display. If 'floatprecision' is set to 1, then the texture "
"gets stored in half-float fp16 format, i.e. 16 bit per color component - Suitable for most display purposes and fast on current "
"gfx-hardware. A value of 2 (the default setting for a HDR onscreen display window) asks for full 32 bit single precision float "
"per color component. Useful for complex computations and image processing, but slower, and takes up twice as much video memory. "
"If a value of 1 is provided, asking for 16 bit floating point textures, but the graphics hardware does not support this, then "
"in non-HDR mode Screen tries to allocate a 15 bit precision signed integer texture instead, if the graphics hardware supports "
"that. Such a texture is more precise than the 16 bit floating point texture it replaces, but can not store values outside the "
"range [-1.0; 1.0]. If the window is a HDR window, then this function will simply fail if floating point storage is not "
"supported, as use of floating point storage is crucial for HDR images. On OpenGL-ES hardware, a 32 bit floating point texture is "
"selected instead.\n"
"'textureOrientation' This optional argument labels textures with a special orientation. "
"Normally (value 0) a Matlab matrix is passed in standard Matlab column-major dataformat. This is efficient for drawing of "
"textures but not for processing them via Screen('TransformTexture'). Therefore textures need to be transformed on demand "
"if used that way. This flag allows to short-cut the process: A setting of 1 will ask for immediate conversion into the "
"optimized format. A setting of 2 will tell PTB that the Matlab matrix has been already converted into optimal format, "
"so no further processing is needed. A value of 3 tells PTB that the texture is completely isotropic, with no real orientation, "
"therefore no conversion is required. This latter setting only makes sense for random noise textures or other textures generated "
"from a distribution with uncorrelated noise-like pixels, e.g., some power spectrum distribution.\n"
"'textureShader' - optional: If you provide the handle of an OpenGL GLSL shader program, then this shader program will be "
"executed (bound) during drawing of this texture via the Screen('DrawTexture',...); command -- The normal texture drawing "
"operation is replaced by your customized algorithm. This is useful for two purposes: a) Very basic on-the-fly image processing "
"on the texture. b) Procedural shading: Your texture matrix doesn't encode an image, but only per-pixel parameters as input "
"for some formula to compute the real image during drawing. E.g., instead of defining a gabor patch as image or other standard "
"stimulus, one could define it as a mathematical formula to be evaluated at draw-time. The Screen('SetOpenGLTexture') command "
"allows you to create purely virtual textures which only consist of such a shader and some virtual size, but don't have any "
"real data matrix associated with it -- all content is generated on the fly.\n";
