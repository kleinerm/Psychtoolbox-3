 *        HISTORY:
 *
 *        21.03.2007        mk        wrote it.
 *        03.04.2011        mk        Make 64 bit clean. Allow 64-bit sized operations and float matrices.
 *        03.04.2011        mk        License changed to MIT with some restrictions.
 *
 *        DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *        Low level Psychtoolbox sound i/o driver. Useful for audio capture, playback and
 *        feedback with well controlled timing and low latency. Uses the free software
 *        PortAudio library, API Version 19 (http://www.portaudio.com), which has a MIT style license.
 *
 *        This seems to link statically against libportaudio.a on OS/X. However, it doesn't!
 *        Due to some restrictions of the OS/X linker we can't link statically against portaudio,
 *        so we have to have a .dylib version of the library installed in a system library
 *        search path, both for compiling and using PsychPortAudio. The current universal
 *        binary version of libportaudio.a for OS/X can be found in the...
 *        PsychSourceGL/Cohorts/PortAudio/ subfolder, which also contains versions for
 *        Linux and Windows.

// and most importantly, it will consume cpu time, bus cycles and hw/interrupts for the running
// audio processing threads inside PortAudio, the OS sound system and device drivers!

// PA_ANTICLAMPGAIN is premultiplied onto any sample provided by usercode, reducing
// signal amplitude by a tiny fraction. This is a workaround for a bug in the
// sampleformat converters in Portaudio for float -> 32 bit int and float -> 24 bit int.
// They cause integer wraparound and thereby audio artifacts if the signal has an
// amplitude of almost +1.0f. This attenuates conformant signals in -1 to +1 range just
// enough to "fix it". Note: The single precision float math inside our driver and inside
// PortAudio limits the effective precision of sound signals to 23 bits + sign = 24 bits,
// so we just manage to properly feed a 24 bit audio DAC, but there's zero headroom left
// for higher precision and our true precision when using gain/volume modulation or mixing
// may be a bit lower than 24 bits due to accumulated numeric roundoff errors. Theoretically
// we could switch to double precision math inside our driver to at least retain 24 bits
// in the mixing/modulation stage.

    "Open a PortAudio audio device and initialize it. Returns a 'pahandle' device handle for the device. "
    "All parameters are optional and have reasonable defaults. 'deviceid' Index to select amongst multiple "
    "logical audio devices supported by PortAudio. Defaults to whatever the systems default sound device is. "
    "Different device id's may select the same physical device, but controlled by a different low-level sound "
    "system. E.g., Windows has about five different sound subsystems. 'mode' Mode of operation. Defaults to "
    "1 == sound playback only. Can be set to 2 == audio capture, or 3 for simultaneous capture and playback of sound. "
    "Note however that mode 3 (full duplex) does not work reliably on all sound hardware. On some hardware this mode "
    "may crash Matlab! There is also a special monitoring mode == 7, which only works for full duplex devices "
    "when using the same number of input- and outputchannels. This mode allows direct feedback of captured sounds "
    "back to the speakers with minimal latency and without involvement of your script at all, however no sound "
    "can be captured during this time and your code mostly doesn't have any control over timing etc. \n"
    "You can also define a audio device as a master device by adding the value 8 to mode. Master devices themselves "
    "are not directly used to playback or capture sound. Instead one can create (multiple) slave devices that are "
    "attached to a master device. Each slave can be controlled independently to playback or record sound through "
    "a subset of the channels of the master device. This basically allows to virtualize a soundcard. See "
    "help for subfunction 'OpenSlave' for more info.\n"
    "'reqlatencyclass' Allows to select how aggressive PsychPortAudio should be about minimizing sound latency "
    "and getting good deterministic timing, i.e. how to trade off latency vs. system load and playing nicely "
    "with other sound applications on the system. Level 0 means: Don't care about latency, this mode works always "
    "and with all settings, plays nicely with other sound applications. Level 1 (the default) means: Try to get "
    "the lowest latency that is possible under the constraint of reliable playback, freedom of choice for all parameters and "
    "interoperability with other applications. Level 2 means: Take full control over the audio device, even if this "
    "causes other sound applications to fail or shutdown. Level 3 means: As level 2, but request the most aggressive "
    "settings for the given device. Level 4: Same as 3, but fail if device can't meet the strictest requirements. "
    "'freq' Requested playback/capture rate in samples per second (Hz). Defaults to a value that depends on the "
    "requested latency mode. 'channels' Number of audio channels to use, defaults to 2 for stereo. If you perform "
    "simultaneous playback and recording, you can provide a 2 element vector for 'channels', specifying different "
    "numbers of output channels and input channels. The first element in such a vector defines the number of playback "
    "channels, the 2nd element defines capture channels. E.g., [2, 1] would define 2 playback channels (stereo) and 1 "
    "recording channel. See the optional 'selectchannels' argument for selection of physical device channels on multi- "
    "channel cards.\n"
    "'buffersize' "
    "requested size and number of internal audio buffers, smaller numbers mean lower latency but higher system load "
    "and some risk of overloading, which would cause audio dropouts. 'suggestedLatency' optional requested latency in "
    "seconds. PortAudio selects internal operating parameters depending on sampleRate, suggestedLatency and buffersize "
    "as well as device internal properties to optimize for low latency output. Best left alone, only here as manual "
    "override in case all the auto-tuning cleverness fails.\n "
    "'selectchannels' optional matrix with mappings of logical channels to device channels: If you only want to use "
    "a subset of the channels present on your sound card, e.g., only 2 playback channels on a 16 channel soundcard, "
    "then you'd set the 'channels' argument to 2. The 'selectchannels' argument allows you to select, e.g.,  which "

    "playback with or without its own set of playback buffers, its own schedule and mode of operation, its own "
    "start and stop times, status etc. Under the hood, the slave device will use the defined subset of channels "
    "of the master device to achieve this illusion of independent soundcards. Typical usage scenarios would be:\n\n"
    "* Mixing of independent soundtracks: Create multiple slave devices, one for each soundtrack. Attach all of "
    "them to the same set of channels on a common master device. Now you can feed each slave with its own soundtrack, "
    "start, stop and schedule playback of each slave/soundtrack independently. Sound from all active channels of "
    "all active slaves will be mixed together and output through the channels of the master device.\n\n"
    "* Independent control of channels: Same as above, but the slaves don't share the same subset of channels "

    "the sound of other slaves attached to the master to allow precisely timed AM modulation. See the help for "
    "PsychPortAudio('Volume') for more details about AM.\n\n"

    "glitches were present in playback and your further playback timing is screwed.\n"

    "follow after the last sample you added during this 'FillBuffer' call, ie., the first sample during a successive "

    "StartTime: Is the real start time of the audio stream after start of playback/recording. If both, playback and "
    "recording are active (full-duplex mode), it is the start time of sound playback, ie an estimate of when the first "
    "sample hit the speakers. Same goes for pure playback. \n"
    "CaptureStartTime: Start time of audio capture (if any is active) - an estimate of when the first sound sample was "
    "captured. In pure capture mode, this is nearly identical to StartTime, but whenever playback is active, StartTime and "
    "CaptureStartTime will differ. CaptureStartTime doesn't take the user provided 'LatencyBias' into account.\n"
    "RequestedStopTime: The requested stop / sound offset time for playback of sounds, as selected via the 'stopTime' "
    "paramter in the 'Start', 'RescheduleStart' or 'Stop' function. This will show a very large (~ infinite) value "
    "if no stop time has been sprecified.\n"
    "EstimatedStopTime: Estimated time when sound playback has stopped. This is an estimate of when exactly the last "
    "audio sample will leave the speaker. The value is zero as long as the estimate isn't available. Due to the latency "
    "involved in sound playback, the value may become available a few msecs before or after actual sound offset.\n"
    "CurrentStreamTime: Estimate of when the most recently submitted sample will hit the speaker. This corresponds "
    "roughly to 'PositionSecs' below, but in absolute realtime.\n"
    "ElapsedOutSamples: Total number of samples played out since start of playback. This count increments monotonically "
    "from start of playback to stop of playback. This denotes the absolute sample position that will hit the speaker "
    "at time 'CurrentStreamTime'. \n"
    "PositionSecs is an estimate of the current stream playback position in seconds within the current playback loop "

    "speakers, i.e., it doesn't take driver and hardware latency into account.\n"
    "SchedulePosition: Current position in a running schedule, if any.\n"
    "XRuns: Number of dropouts due to buffer overrun or underrun conditions. This is not perfectly reliable, "
    "as the algorithm can miss some dropouts. Iow.: A non-zero or increasing value means that audio glitches "
    "during playback or capture happened, but a zero or constant value doesn't mean everything was glitch-free, "
    "because some glitches can't get reliably detected on some operating systems or audio hardware.\n"
    "TotalCalls, TimeFailed and BufferSize are only for debugging of PsychPortAudio itself.\n"
    "CPULoad: How much load does the playback engine impose on the CPU? Values can range from 0.0 = 0% "

    "or sound glitches are likely. In such a case, try to reduce the load on your system.\n"
    "PredictedLatency: Is the latency in seconds of your driver+hardware combo. It tells you, "
    "how far ahead of time a sound device must be started ahead of the requested onset time via "
    "PsychPortAudio('Start'...) to make sure it actually starts playing in time. High quality systems like "
    "Linux or MacOS/X may allow values as low as 5 msecs or less on standard hardware. Other operating "
    "systems may require dozens or hundreds of milliseconds of headstart. Caution: In full-duplex mode, "
    "this value only refers to the latency on the sound output, not in the sound input! Also, this is just "
    "an estimate, not 100% reliable.\n"
    "LatencyBias: Is an additional bias setting you can impose via PsychPortAudio('LatencyBias', pahandle, bias); "

    "unmodified, a value of 0.5 would reduce intensity to 50%, a value of 1.25 would amplify "
    "to 125% of the original value, or a value of -1 would invert the signal.\n"
    "Be careful with amplification (values > 1). If the final sample leaves the valid output "
    "range of -1.0 to 1.0, you may hear ugly auditory clipping artifacts and possibly damage "
    "your ears or speakers! In 'normal' mode, PsychPortAudio clamps output samples to the valid "
    "range of -1 to 1, but in high timing precision/low latency mode, clamping is not performed "
    "in order to save computation time.\n\n"
    "Caution: All volume settings are silently ignored on regular audio devices or master devices "
    "if audio monitoring mode is active. On a slave device, per-channel volumes would be still applied "
    "in monitoring mode, but not the masterVolume. This is for efficiency reasons. If you need volume "
    "settings in monitoring mode, then open a master device, attach a slave device to it in monitoring "
    "mode, then set the 'channelVolumes' of that slave device to control volume of monitoring.\n\n"
    "Caution: The volume settings only affect what is sent to your computers sound system. The "
    "operating system or audio hardware itself may apply additional volume settings, gains, filters "
    "etc., depending on your specific setup. These are only controllable via external system specific tools, "
    "PsychPortAudio doesn't know about such additional settings and can't control them in any way!\n\n"
    "If you need to modulate output volume over time, you can also attach an additional slave "
    "device whose opMode is set to act as an AMmodulator to a master or slave device, see help for 'OpenSlave'. "
    "Such a slave device will not output sound itself, but use the data stored in its playback "
    "buffers to modulate the amplitude of its parent slave, or of the summed signal of all previously "
    "attached slaves for a master over time. Example: You create a master device, then 'OpenSlave' three regular slave "
    "devices, then 'OpenSlave' a AMmodulator slave device. During playback, the sound signals "
    "of the three regular slaves will be mixed together. The combined signal will be multiplied "
    "by the per-sample volume values provided by the AMmodulator slave device, thereby modulating "
    "the amplitude or ''acoustic envelope'' of the mixed signals. The resulting signal will be "
    "played by the master device. If you'd attach more regular slave devices after the AMmodulator, "
    "their signal would not get modulated, but simply added to the modulated signal of the first "
    "three devices.\n\n"
    "You can also modulate only the signals of a specific slave device, by attaching the modulator "
    "to that slave device in the 'OpenSlave' call. You'd simply pass the handle of the slave that "
    "should be modulated to 'OpenSlave', instead of the handle of a master device.\n\n";

    "The device must be open for this setting to take effect. Changed settings may or may not "
    "persist across closing and opening the device, this is hardware dependent and not to be relied on.\n"
    "So-called \"Zero latency direct input monitoring\" is a hardware feature of some modern "
    "(and usually higher end) soundcards. It allows to directly feed audio signals that are received "
    "at the audio input connectors of the soundcard back to the output connectors, without any extended "
    "intermediate processing of the audio signals by either the sound hardware or the host computer and "
    "its software. Due to this direct signal path, which only applies selectable amplification and "
    "some stereo panning and rerouting, the feedback latency from input to output (e.g, microphone to "
    "speakers) is as minimal as technically possible. On many high-end cards it is instantaneous!\n\n"
    "The 'enable' flag is mandatory: If set to zero, monitoring will be disabled for the given 'inputChannel'. "
    "A setting of one will enable input live-monitoring of the given 'inputChannel' to the given 'outputChannel' with "
    "the selected other settings.\n"
    "All following settings are optional and have reasonable defaults. Depending on your hardware, some or all of them "
    "may be silently ignored by your sound hardware.\n"
    "The optional 'inputChannel' argument specifies which input audio channels monitoring settings should be modified. "
    "If omitted or set to -1, all input channels settings will be modified, or at least tried to be modified.\n"
    "The optional 'outputChannel' specifies the index of the base-channel of a channel stereo-pair to which the 'inputChannel' "
    "should be routed. It must be an even number like 0, 2, 4, .... If omitted, channel 0, i.e., the first output channel "
    "stereo pair will be used. This at least on ASIO soundcards under MS-Windows.\n"
    "The optional 'gainLevel' defines the desired amplifier gain for the routed signal. The value should be negative for "
    "signal attenuation (i.e., negative gain) and positive for amplification (i.e., positive gain). "
    "As specification of gains is not standardized across operating systems, the numbers you'll have to pass in for a desired "
    "effect will vary across operating systems and audio hardware. However, the default setting of zero tries to set a neutral "
    "gain of zero decibel - the signal is passed through without change in intensity. On MS-Windows with ASIO soundcards, values "
    "between 0.0 and 1.0 will select gains between 0 and 12 dB. Values between 0.0 and -1.0 will select negative gains between "
    "0 and -infinity dB, ie., full attenuation. The setting may get completely ignored or only approximately implemented by given "
    "hardware. Double-check your results!\n"
    "The optional 'stereoPan' parameter allows to select panning between the two output channels of a selected stereo output "
    "channel pair if the hardware allows that. Range 0.0 - 1.0 selects between left-channel and right channel, with the default "
    "of 0.5 selecting a centered output with equal distribution to both channels.\n\n"
    "In the optional return argument 'result' the function returns a status code to report if the requested change could be carried "
    "out successfully. A value of zero means success. A value of 1 means some error, e.g., invalid parameters specified. A value of "
    "2 means that your combinatin of operating system, sound system, soundcard device driver and soundcard hardware does not support "
    "direct input monitoring, at least not for the given configuration. A setting of 3 means that your PortAudio driver plugin does "
    "not support the feature - You may need to update your plugin from the Psychtoolbox Wiki.\n\n"
    "The current PsychPortAudio driver supports direct input monitoring on MacOS/X with certain sound hardware (but not the builtin sound) "
    "and on Microsoft Windows systems with ASIO-2.0 capable sound "
    "hardware, and only if the latest portaudio_x86.dll ASIO plugin is installed from our Wiki. Even then, only a subset of ASIO-2 "
    "hardware may support this feature and only a subset of these may support all parameters. According to vendor documentation, some "
    "soundcards from Creative Labs and many of RME's cards do support this feature.\n"
