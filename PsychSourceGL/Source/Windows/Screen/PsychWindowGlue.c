    HISTORY:

        12/20/02        awi        Wrote it mostly by modifying SDL-specific refugees (from an experimental SDL-based Psychtoolbox).
        11/16/04        awi        Added description.
        4/22/05                mk              Added support for OpenGL stereo windows and enhanced Flip-behaviour:
                                                        Flip'ing at specified deadline, retaining instead of clear'ing backbuffer during flip,
                                                        return of stimulus onset related timestamps, properly syncing to VBL.
                 4/29/05                mk              Additional safety checks for VBL sync in PsychOpenOnscreenWindow().
                 5/14/05                mk              Additional safety checks for insufficient gfx-hardware and multi-display setups,
                                                        failing beam-position queries. New refresh interval estimation code, reworked Flip.
                 5/19/05                mk              Extra check for 'flipwhen' values over 1000 secs in future: Abort.
                 5/30/05                mk              Check for Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 1) -> Shortened tests, if set.
                 6/09/05                mk              Experimental support for busy-waiting for VBL and for multi-flip of stereo displays.
                 9/30/05                mk              Added PsychRealtimePriority for improving timing tests in PsychOpenWindow()
                 9/30/05                mk              Added check for Screen('Preference', 'VisualDebugLevel', level) -> Amount of vis. feedback.
                 10/10/05               mk              Important Bugfix for PsychRealtimePriority() - didn't switch back to non-RT priority!!
         10/19/05        awi        Cast NULL to CGLPixelFormatAttribute type to make the compiler happy.

    DESCRIPTION:

        Functions in this file comprise an abstraction layer for probing and controlling window state, except for window content.

        Each C function which implements a particular Screen subcommand should be platform neutral.  For example, the source to SCREENPixelSizes()
        should be platform-neutral, despite that the calls in OS X and Windows to detect available pixel sizes are different.  The platform
        specificity is abstracted out in C files which end it "Glue", for example PsychScreenGlue, PsychWindowGlue, PsychWindowTextClue.

    NOTES:

        Technical information about the Windows-Vista display driver model (WDDM 1.0) and later: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms796755.aspx
        Contains details about driver interfaces, memory management, GPU scheduling, swap control etc.
        Official name: "Windows Vista Display Driver Model Design Guide"

        Useful information about the Vista et al. Direct-X Graphics kernel subsystem: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee415671(VS.85).aspx
        OpenGL ICD's on Vista and later communicate with the GPU (or more accurately, the Display Miniport Driver of the GPU) through the
        Direct-X Graphics kernel subsystem. For that reason it is helpful to understand its internal working, as some of its properties and
        of the DirectX/Direct3D driver settings may also affect OpenGL rendering and stimulus presentation.

/* Internal method, called by PsychOSOpenOnscreenWindow(): Optimize present parameters
 * for Windows DWM compositor, to minimize its interference with our presentation timing
 * in the cases where we can't avoid DWM compositing completely.
 *
 * All we do is disable queued presentation mode, as this is deprecated and didn't ever
 * work well at all in the first place. Also we set the number of buffers in the buffer
 * queue to the absolute allowable minimum of 2 buffers, trying to force the DWM to not
 * queue up anything.
 *
 * This optimization is inspired by the one used by Google's ANGLE project for
 * OpenGL rendering over DirectX-10. ANGLE is used for the WebGL implementation of
 * the Chromium and Firefox web browsers on Windows, so we assume they know what they're
 * doing. See the setup code for the Surface::initialize() method in ANGLE's libEGL
 * implementation: <code.google.com/p/angleproject/source/browse/trunk/src/libEGL/Surface.cpp>
 *
 * In any case, this is just band-aid, as the only decent way to get good performance
 * and timing is to not have the DWM active on the stimulus presentation display. We
 * achieve this by actively disabling the DWM on Windows Vista and Windows-7. On Windows-8
 * we can't do that, but apparently the DWM auto-disables at least for fullscreen onscreen
 * stimulus displays, similar to what Linux compositors do when unredirect_fullscreen_windows
 * mode is requested. This optimization only applies to half-transparent "debug windows" or
 * non fullscreen windows, or when running on a Windows-8 + setup with broken DWM switching.

    // Java based GetChar implementation, so use of GetChar and of this feature
    // is mutually exclusive. This mode is needed on some degenerated Windows-2000 and
    // Windows-XP systems under some weird conditions. It is also crucially needed on
    // MS-Vista, Windows-7 and later to achieve tear-free double-buffered stimulus onset via
    // page-flipping that is hardware-sychronized to VSYNC. Without this flag, the window is
    // not considered a "real", unoccluded fullscreen window, with the consequence that if
    // the DWM is enabled, it will not auto-suspend but stay in the loop and perform compositing
    // (--> bad performance), and if the DWM is disabled in "Classic mode", the DirectX
    // graphics kernel subsystem will prevent use of VSYNC'ed page-flipping, but revert to
    // VSYNC-IRQ triggered BitBlt's --> Tearing and timing trouble on systems with bad ISR timing!
    //
    // The documentation for the DirectX function "IDXGISwapChain::SetFullscreenState", to be found
    // at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee421963(VS.85).aspx contains the conditions for
    // "true" fullscreen mode. Swapchains are the underlying DirectX mechanism for OpenGL double-buffers
    // and the bufferswap operations. A SwapBuffers() OpenGL call eventually results in a DirectX
    // Present() call to enqueue the backbuffer in the swapchain which will perform the actual swap.
    // Only swapchains in fullscreen mode will use page-flipping with hardware VSYNC triggers, this is
    // why it is important that our windows satisfy above documented fullscreen conditions.
    //
    //
    // Soo, these are the rules for enabling this mode:
    // 1. If the kPsychPreventForegroundWindow flag is set, we won't enable --> This is a master-off switch.
    // 2. If the kPsychEnforceForegroundWindow flag is set, we will enable unconditionally.
    // 3. If neither of the above is true, we will not enable on WinXP, Win2000 and earlier, but
    //    we will enable on Vista, Windows-7 and later iff a regular, non-transparent (windowLevel >= 2000)

 *                video refreshes. As far as i understand, this value affects the first bufferswap after the call.

 *                    a value of 100 would want the DWM to schedule swaps at a rate of 100 Hz. If set to a value
 *                    <=0, the abs(rateDuration) encodes the delta between successive bufferswaps in refresh cycles,

 *                    The most useful settings for us would be either rateDuration == nominal video refresh rate of
 *                    display (Hz), or -1 for "swap each refresh" or maybe 0 for "swap immediately" (if zero is a valid setting?).
 *

 *                    between 2 and 8 for Vista and Windows-7.

    divisor, remainder - If set to non-zero, msc at swap must satisfy (msc % divisor) == remainder.
    specialFlags - Additional options. Unused so far.

    Return value:
