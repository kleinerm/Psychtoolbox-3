% [fractionBleached] = ComputePhtopigmentBleaching(irradiance,[receptorType],[units],[source],[initialFraction],[timeUnits])
%
% Compute fraction of photopigment bleached, given irradiance of light
% reaching the eye.
%
% There are two distinct uses, controlled by the value of initialFraction.
%
% Usage 1 - If initialFraction is not passed or is empty, the steady state
% fraction of pigment bleached is returned for each irradiance in the
% passed input irradiance.
%
% Usage 2 - If initialFraction is passed as a scalar, this is taken as the
% time zero fraction bleached, and inputirradiance is taken to be the time
% variying irradiance, with fractionBleached the time varying fraction
% bleached.
%
% When time varying signals are handled, the unit of time is as specified
% by the timeunits argument (default, msec).
%
% As far as I can tell, the fundemantal measurements of the half-bleach
% constant for human cones were made by Rushton and Henry (1968, Vision Research,
% 8, 617-631). This fact I learned from CVRL
% (http://www.cvrl.org/database/text/intros/introbleaches.htm).
%
% I am pretty sure that the Rushton and Henry measurements were made for
% 560 nm light, and they give (see their Figure 2) a half-bleach constant
% of 4.3 log10 trolands (20,000 td). This number is also given in Boynton
% and Kaiser, Human Color Vision, 2nd edition, pp 211 and following.
%
% It's probably fine to compute bleaching for L and M cones given retinal
% illuminance in trolands, given that these are effects that matter over
% log10 units.  But trolands are not going to help much for the S-cones.
% According to CVRL there aren't good measurements for the half-bleaching
% constant for S cones because putting enough short-wavelength light onto
% the retina to bleach the S cones is not good for the eyes.
%
% None-the-less, it seems nice to have this routine written so that it will
% return a number if you give it irradiance either in trolands or in
% isomerizations/cone-sec.  For 560 nm light and the CIE 10 deg
% fundamentals, I compute that 1 td is 137 isomerizations/cone-sec for L
% cones and 110 isomerizations/cone-sec for M cones.  Take the weighted
% average value of (2*L + 1*M) = 128 and multiply by (10.^4.3) to get a
% half-bleach constant in isomerizations/cone-sec of  2.55e+06 (6.4 log10
% isomerizations/cone-sec). [Computations done 6/2/14 using
% IsomerizationsInEyeDemo and setting the fundamentals to 'CIE10deg' and
% wavelength to 560 nm by hand in the code.  These are for the 'Boynton'
% source.]
%
% [ASIDE: I used 10 deg fundamentals to compute the bleaching constant
% expressed in terms of isomerizations, because I figure that Rushton's
% measurements are based on a fairly large field.  Because the macular
% pigment absorbs a fair amount of light, this matters.  If I compute
% instead with 2-deg fundamentals, I get that 1 td is 23.7 L cone
% isomerizations/cone-sec and 19.5 M cone isomerizations/cone-sec.   These
% two numbers are ballpark consistent with Rodiek page 475 who gives 18.3
% and 15.9 for a monochromatic 540 THz light (555 nm)].

%   bleaching in cone photoreceptors in situ in the retina
%   of the turtle." Journal of Neuroscience 14.3 (1994):
%   1091-1105.
% provides a half bleach constant for turtle cones of 5.57 expressed
% in log10 R*/um2/sec, which could with some work be converted to
% isomerizations/cone/sec for turtle cones. But it's not
% clear you want to use that number unless you are studying turtle.
%
% This routine will do the computation either on the basis of input in
% trolands or input in isomerization/cone-sec, using the appropirate
% constant as above.  Note that the computation of isomerizations takes
% into account lens and macular pigment, while the troland value is the
% straight troland value.  A second advantage of using units of
% isomerizations/cone-sec is that you can compute this for other regions of
% the visual field and presumably the numbers will be about right.  You can
% also compute for S-cones on the assumption that the half-bleach constant
% is the same for S-cones as for L- and M- cones.
%
% As far as I can tell, the computations and analysis of bleaching do not
% take into account changes in isomerization rate that occur because of
% change in spectral sensitivity of cones with bleaching.  That is, the
% measurements are simply of steady state pigment density and are modeled
% with a formula that assumes monochromatic light (see treatment in
% Boynton).

% irradiance    -- retinal irradiance specified as determined by units. If
%                  initialFraction is empty, this is a single number and
%                  steady state bleaching fraction is returned.  If
%                  initialFraction is a number, then this is a time series
%                  of irradiance versus time, and fraction bleached for the
%                  same times is returned.
