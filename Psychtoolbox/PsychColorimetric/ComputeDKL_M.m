function M = ComputeDKL_M(bg)% M = ComputeDKL_M(bg)% % Compute the matrix that converts between incremental cone% coordinates and DKL space.%% The code follows that published by Brainard% as an appendix to Human Color Vision by Kaiser% and Boynton.%% 8/30/96  dhb  Pulled it out.% Set M_raw as in equation A.4.9.% This is found by plugging the background% values into equation A.4.8.  Different% backgrounds produce different matrices.% The Matlab notation below just % fills the desired 3-by-3 matrix.M_raw = [ 1 1 0 ; ...					1 -bg(1)/bg(2) 0 ; ...				 -1 -1 (bg(1)+bg(2))/bg(3) ];% Compute the inverse of M for% equation A.4.10.  The Matlab inv() function% computes the matrix inverse of its argument.M_raw_inv = inv(M_raw);% Find the three isolating stimuli as% the columns of M_inv_raw.  The Matlab% notation X(:,i) extracts the i-th column% of the matrix X.isochrom_raw = M_raw_inv(:,1);rgisolum_raw = M_raw_inv(:,2);sisolum_raw = M_raw_inv(:,3);% Find the pooled cone contrast of each% of these.  The Matlab norm() function returns% the vector length of its argument.  The Matlab% ./ operation represents entry-by-entry division.isochrom_raw_pooled = norm(isochrom_raw ./ bg);rgisolum_raw_pooled = norm(rgisolum_raw ./ bg);sisolum_raw_pooled = norm(sisolum_raw ./ bg);% Scale each mechanism isolating% modulation by its pooled contrast to obtain% mechanism isolating modulations that have% unit length.isochrom_unit = isochrom_raw / isochrom_raw_pooled;rgisolum_unit = rgisolum_raw / rgisolum_raw_pooled;sisolum_unit = sisolum_raw / sisolum_raw_pooled;% Compute the values of the normalizing% constants by plugging the unit isolating stimuli% into A.4.9 and seeing what we get.  Each vector% should have only one non-zero entry.  The size% of the entry is the response of the unscaled% mechanism to the stimulus that should give unit% response.lum_resp_raw = M_raw*isochrom_unit;l_minus_m_resp_raw = M_raw*rgisolum_unit;s_minus_lum_resp_raw = M_raw*sisolum_unit;						 % We need to rescale the rows of M_raw% so that we get unit response.  This means% multiplying each row of M_raw by a constant.% The easiest way to accomplish the multiplication% is to form a diagonal matrix with the desired% scalars on the diagonal.  These scalars are just% the multiplicative inverses of the non-zero% entries of the vectors obtained in the previous% step.  The resulting matrix M provides the% entries of A.4.11.  The three _resp vectors% computed should be the three unit vectors% (and they are).D_rescale = [1/lum_resp_raw(1) 0 0 ; ...						 0 1/l_minus_m_resp_raw(2) 0 ; ...						 0 0 1/s_minus_lum_resp_raw(3) ];				 M = D_rescale*M_raw;lum_resp = M*isochrom_unit;l_minus_m_resp = M*rgisolum_unit;s_minus_lum_resp = M*sisolum_unit;% Compute the inverse of M to obtain% the matrix in equation A.4.12.M_inv = inv(M);
