% Psychtoolbox.
% Version 3.0.14      30 December 2016
%
% The Psychophysics Toolbox is a collection of Octave and Matlab functions
% that extend the language to give you exquisite control of your computer
% to test observers with research-grade dynamic stimuli.
%
% Every Psychtoolbox function has its own documentation available through
% the Matlab HELP command, and, in the case of MEX files, through the
% function itself. We've tried hard to make these individual bits of
% documentation clear, accurate, and complete. We're grateful to receive
% corrections.
%
% We've mostly followed Mathworks's help-text conventions, but note that in
% our help text we designate optional arguments to function calls by
% embracing them with square brackets. You're not meant to include these
% brackets when you actually call the function. For example, "help Snd"
% will tell you this:
%
%      err = Snd(command,[sig],[rate])
%
% meaning that the "command" argument is required and the "sig" and "rate"
% arguments are optional. A typical call to Snd looks like this:
%
%      Snd('Play', mysoundsignal)
%
% The most important and generally useful functions, especially Screen, are
% in PsychBasic. The PsychDemos will show you how to do useful things in
% Matlab with the Psychtoolbox. Try these:
%
%      help PsychDemos       % Triple-click me & hit enter.
%      help PsychBasic
%      help Screen
%      Screen OpenWindow?
%
% The folder PsychDocumentation contains bits of documentation about
% technical implementation details, how to solve specific tasks and how to
% troubleshoot common problems.
%
% To read more, look at the "intro" and "docs" pages at the web site. The
% web site also has advice about getting help, the Psychtoolbox forum, and
% the latest information about bugs and new releases:

% Peter Scarfe has written a large set of nice and beginner friendly
% Psychtoolbox tutorial scripts.

% research, you might say something like this, "We wrote our experiments in
% Matlab, using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Kleiner et al, 2007)"
