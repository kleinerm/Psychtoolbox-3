function rc = PsychLicenseHandling(cmd, varargin)
% PsychLicenseHandling - Manage Psychtoolbox software licensing.
%
% This function facilitates the setup and administration of license
% management for Psychtoolbox on operating systems and platforms that
% require either a paid license or a time-limited free trial.
%
% Once license management is configured for your operating system and
% hardware, you can manage your license, including activation and
% deactivation on a machine, checking licensing status, and generating a
% support authentication token.
%
% For information on purchasing license keys for Psychtoolbox, visit:

%
% The prebuilt, tested, and supported mex files included in Psychtoolbox
% are provided by our commercial host company, the Medical Innovations
% Incubator GmbH, as of December 2024. Contact details are as follows:

% The data protection and privacy statements related to Psychtoolbox
% software license management and associated data collection and processing
% can be found at:
%
% https://www.psychtoolbox.net/data-protection
%
% Once a license has been activated online, you can use the Psychtoolbox
% mex files offline for a limited number of days without an active internet
% connection. After this offline period, the mex files will stop working
% until an internet connection is reestablished. During each startup,
% Psychtoolbox will inform you of the remaining days of offline use before
% your computer must connect to the internet while Psychtoolbox is running.
% Each successful connection to the license servers will reset the offline
% use period to its maximum duration. When connected to the internet,
% Psychtoolbox will sync with the server at the first use in a session and
% periodically every few hours.
%
% If your local environments firewall prevents online license management from
% working, see the section at the bottom for how to add firewall exception rules
% to make it work anyway. Below that section you will also find instructions for
% operating in a fully offline "air gapped" environment without any internet access.
% The latter may require specially configured licenses, as our default licenses do
% not support fully offline use.
%
% Subfunctions and their meaning:
% -------------------------------
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('Setup');
% - Informs the user about the purpose of license management, asks them for
% consent to enable license management, and performs initial setup to get
% to working mex files for license managed Psychtoolboxes. This function
% can be manually called by users, but by default it is called by the
% Psychtoolbox setup/install/update routines to automate license onboarding.
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('SetupLicense');
% - Like 'Setup', but always prompts for a new license key, even if a key
% is already enrolled, or a trial is active at the moment.
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('SetupGlobal');
% - This behaves mostly like 'Setup', but it is meant for system administrators
% or IT personnel to create a global configuration file to express consent to
% license management on behalf of all users of this Psychtoolbox installation,
% and also to store a license key for automatic node activation. The global
% configuration file will be stored in the Psychtoolbox main folder, ie. the
% folder printed by the PsychtoolboxRoot() function. You can use this function
% if you use disc imaging software or similar provisioning tools to install and
% setup a Psychtoolbox installation once as part of a provisioning image, then
% clone the provisioning image and Psychtoolbox installation to many physical
% machines. The global config file will cause each Psychtoolbox on each of the
% provisioned machines to activate and setup license management and activate that
% node at first use of Psychtoolbox.
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('Activate' [, licenseKeyOrUserCredential]);
% - Activate a paid license on a machine + operating system combination.
% This can either use a previously enrolled license key from earlier calls
% of PsychLicenseHandling('Activate') or PsychLicenseHandling('Setup'), or
% providing a new license key to activate the machine with a new license,
% by providing the new key in a string as optional 'licenseKeyOrUserCredential'
% parameter. Instead of a license key, one can also enter the login credentials
% of a user account with associated license key, to fetch the associated key
% automatically, e.g., if the account is jon.doe@doeland.us with password oink,
% then the credentials would be the following text: jon.doe@doeland.us:oink
%
% This function can also be used if your machine was offline longer than
% allowed and your local activation needs to be refreshed, or if your old
% license has expired, or been suspended for some reason, then been resumed
% or extended by you, and you need Psychtoolbox to refresh its view of the
% current licensing state. If things don't work for some licensing related
% reason, calling PsychLicenseHandling('Activate') may fix many problems.
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('Deactivate');
% - Deactivate a currently activated machine + operating system combination,
% for the purpose of freeing up one activation, so a different machine +
% operating system combination can be activated instead. This allows you to
% "shift around" which machines can be used if your license only allows a
% limited number of simultaneous activations on a limited number of
% machines, and you temporarily have more machines than available
% activations.
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('WipeLicense');
% - Deactivate a license on a machine and wipe the license key permanently
% if you don't intend to use that license on this machine anymore, e.g., if
% you are about to decomission a machine, or no longer use that license.
%
% active = PsychLicenseHandling('IsLicensed' [, feature]);
% - Check if this installation of Psychtoolbox currently has a valid and
% active license, and possibly print some information about the licensing
% status, e.g., license expiry date, or how long the machine can still be
% used offline. If the optional 'feature' parameter is provided as a name
% string, then checks if that specific subfeature is enabled by the
% currently active license.
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('AuthenticationToken');
% - Print an authentication token which allows you to prove that your
% machine has a properly paid, valid and active license associated with it.
% Our professional support personnel may ask you to provide such a token in
% some cases.
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('News');
% - Print latest stored news about Psychtoolbox, and also specifically related to
% this license and activations. Psychtoolbox prints those messages automatically
% once when they are new. This function will print them even if they have been
% printed before.
%
%
% USE IN STRICTLY FIREWALLED ENVIRONMENTS:
% ----------------------------------------
%
% If your firewall is blocking internet connections to our license servers,
% you can configure it as follows to allow connecting to the license servers.
% Follow the most recent instructions on this website for passthrough for EU data centers:
%
% https://docs.cryptlex.com/node-locked-licenses/proxies-and-firewall#for-our-eu-data-center
%
% As of March 2025, the following configuration would be needed, but check above
% website for up to date informations if in doubt:
%
% The following IP addresses and URL should be whitelisted:
%
%    IP Addresses to Whitelist:
%        75.2.113.112
%        99.83.149.57
%
%    Web API URL to Whitelist:
%        https://api.eu.cryptlex.com:443
%
% OFFLINE USE IN AIR GAPPED ENVIRONMENTS:
% ---------------------------------------
%
% Some non-standard software subscription licenses allow offline activation and
% deactivation by use of the customer portal and passing forth and back offline
% activation and deactivation request and response files. This allows use in air-
% gapped environments without access to the public internet or to our license
% servers. If your purchased license supports this, the functions are as follows:
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('ActivateEnrolledKeyOffline', pathToOfflineRequestResponseFile);
% - Either create an offline activation request file under the specified path/filename,
% which allows creation of an offline activation response file in the customer portal,
% or reads such an offline activation response file and activates your local machine.
%
% E.g., after enrolling a license key via PsychLicenseHandling('Setup') or
% PsychLicenseHandling('Activate', licenseKey); do the following:
%
% 1. PsychLicenseHandling('ActivateEnrolledKeyOffline', 'offlineRequest.dat');
%
% 2. Login to customer portal and upload 'offlineRequest.dat' to create offline
%    response file, downloaded to the file 'offlineResponse.dat'.
%
% 3. PsychLicenseHandling('ActivateEnrolledKeyOffline', 'offlineResponse.dat') to
%    activate this machine.
%
% PsychLicenseHandling('DeactivateEnrolledKeyOffline', pathToOfflineProofFile);
% - Deactivate the machine locally and write a deactivation proof file into the
% path/filename 'pathToOfflineProofFile'. You can upload that proof file into
% the customer portal to deactivate the machine in the license servers, so the
% machine activation that has been freed up can be reused on a different machine.
% Not all licenses allow offline deactivation of once activated machines.
