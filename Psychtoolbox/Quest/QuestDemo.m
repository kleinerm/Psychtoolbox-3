% One of the great contributions of psychophysics to psychology is the
% notion of measuring threshold, i.e. the signal strength required for a
% criterion level of response by the observer (Pelli & Farell, 1994;
% Farell & Pelli, 1999). Watson and Pelli (1983) described a maximum
% likelihood procedure, which they called QUEST, for estimating threshold.
% The Quest toolbox in the Psychtoolbox is a set of MATLAB functions
% that implement all the original QUEST functions, plus several others.
% You can think of it as a Bayesian toolbox for testing observers and
% estimating their thresholds. This QUEST toolbox is self-contained,
% and runs on any computer with MATLAB 5 or better.

% 
% By commenting and uncommenting five lines below, you can use this file
% to implement three QUEST-related procedures for measuring threshold.
% 
% QuestMode: In the original algorithm of Watson & Pelli (1983), each
% trial is at the MODE of the posterior pdf. Their final estimate is
% maximum likelihood, which is the MODE of the posterior pdf after
% dividing out the prior pdf. (Subsequent experience has shown that it's
% better not to divide out the prior, simply using MODE of posterior pdf
% throughout.)
% 
% QuestMean: In the improved algorithm of King-Smith et al. (1994), each
% trial and the final estimate are at the MEAN of the posterior pdf.
% 
% QuestQuantile & QuestMean: In the ideal algorithm of Pelli (1987), each
% trial is at the best QUANTILE, and the final estimate is at the MEAN of
% the posterior pdf.
% 
% You begin by calling QuestCreate, telling Quest what is your prior
% knowledge, i.e. a guess and associated sd for threshold. Then you run
% some number of trials, typically 40. For each trial you ask Quest to
% recommend a test intensity. Then you actually test the observer at some
% intensity, not necessarily what Quest recommended, and then you call
% QuestUpdate to report to Quest the actual intensity used and whether the
% observer got it right. Quest saves this information in your Quest struct, 
% which we usually call "q". This cycle is repeated for each trial. Finally,
% at the end, when you're done, you ask Quest to provide a final threshold
% estimate, usually the mean and sd (of the posterior pdf).
% 
% It is important to realize that Quest is merely a friendly adviser,
% cataloging your data in your q structure, and making statistical
% analyses of it, but never giving you orders. You're still in charge. On
% each trial, you ask Quest (by calling QuestMode, or QuestMean, or
% QuestQuantile) to suggest the best intensity for the next trial. Taking
% that as advice, in your experiment you should then select the intensity
% yourself for the next trial, taking into account the limitations of your
% equipment and experiment. Typically you'll impose a maximum and a
% minimum, but your equipment may also restrict you to particular discrete
% values, and you might have some reason for not repeating a value.
% Typically you'll choose the available intensity closest to what Quest
% recommended. In some cases the process of producing the stimulus is so
% involved that the exact stimulus intensity is known only after it's been 
% shown. Having run the trial, you then report the new datum,
% the actual intensity tested and the observer's response, asking Quest to
% add it to the database in q.
% 
% To use Quest you must provide an estimated value for beta. Beta
% controls the steepness of the Weibull function. Many vision studies use
% Michelson contrast to control the visibility of the stimulus. It turns
% out that psychometric functions for 2afc detection as a function of
% contrast have a beta of roughly 3 for a remarkably wide range of targets
% and conditions (Nachmias, 1981). However, you may want to estimate beta
% for the particular conditions of your experiment. QuestBetaAnalysis is
% provided for that purpose, but please think of it as a limited optional
% feature. It allows only two free parameters, threshold and beta. You may
% prefer to use a general-purpose maximum likelihood fitting program to
% allow more degrees of freedom in fitting a Weibull function to your
% psychometric data. However, once you've done that it's likely that
% you'll settle on fixed values for all but threshold and use Quest to
% estimate that.
% 
% Note that data collected to estimate threshold usually are not
% good for estimating beta. The psychometric function is sigmoidal, with a
% flat floor, a rise, and a flat ceiling. To estimate threshold you want
% all your trials near the steepest (roughly speaking) part of the rise.
% To estimate beta, the steepness of the rise, you want to have most of
% your trials at the corners, where the rise begins and where it ends. The
% usual way to achieve this is to first estimate threshold and then to
% collect a large number of trials (e.g. 100) at each of several
% intensities chosen to span the domain of the rise. These data can
% be plotted, making a nice graph of the psychometric function and
% they can be fed to QuestBetaAnalysis, to estimate threshold and beta.
