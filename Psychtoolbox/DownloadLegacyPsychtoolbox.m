%
% THIS SCRIPT IS CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL. Contact the PTB forum for
% help if you need old copies of PTB, or check on the PTB website for
% instructions.
%

% CAUTION: This script is for legacy downloads. Use DownloadPsychtoolbox
% for downloads of the current Psychtoolbox 3.0.10 or later. Psychtoolbox
% 3.0.9 and earlier are completely unsupported and unmaintained!
%
% This script downloads *old versions* of Psychtoolbox-3, specifically
% version 3.0.9 or earlier from the Subversion master server at GoogleCode
% to your disk, creating your working copy, ready to use as a new toolbox
% in your MATLAB/OCTAVE application. Subject to your permission, any old
% installation of the Psychtoolbox is first removed. It's a careful
% program, checking for all required resources and privileges before it
% starts.
%
% CAUTION: Psychtoolbox 3.0.9 and earlier *will not work* with 64 bit
% versions of Matlab or Octave, except if you use a GNU/Linux system, e.g.,
% Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu Linux 10.04 or later. The NeuroDebian project
% (see http://neuro.debian.net) provides a very convinient installation of
% Psychtoolbox for both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Octave and Matlab via
% the regular package management system of your Linux distribution.
%
% On Mac OSX, all parameters are optional. On MS-Windows and GNU/Linux, the
% first parameter "targetdirectory" with the path to the installation
% target directory is required. The "targetdirectory" name may not contain
% any white space, otherwise download will fail with mysterious error
% messages!
% 
% On OSX, your working copy of the Psychtoolbox will be placed in either
% your /Applications or your /Users/Shared folder (depending on permissions
% and your preference), or you may specify a 'targetdirectory', as you
% prefer.
%
% On Microsoft Windows, you must specify the full path, including
% the drive name where Psychtoolbox should be installed, e.g.,
% 'C:\MyToolboxes\'.
%
% The desired flavor of a Psychtoolbox release can be selected via the
% optional "flavor" parameter: By default, 'beta' (aka 'current') will be
% installed if you don't specify otherwise, as this is almost always the
% best possible choice. You can download an old versioned release via a
% namestring like 'Psychtoolbox-x.y.z', e.g., 'Psychtoolbox-3.0.7' if you'd
% want to download version 3.0.7. This is only useful if you run a very old
% operating system or Matlab version that isn't supported by the current
% "beta" anymore, so you'd need to stick with an old versioned release.
% People that really love trouble can also download the 'unsupported'
% flavor. "Unsupported" was formerly known as "stable" but the new name
% reflects reality much better and accurately describes the level of support
% you can expect from us if you use it and run into any trouble!
%
%
% Normally your download should just work(TM). The installer knows three
% different methods of download and tries all of them if neccessary, ie.,
% if the preferred method fails, the 2nd best is tried etc. Should the
% installer get stuck for an inappropriate amount of time (More than 5-10
% minutes), you can try to abort it and restart it, providing the
% additional 'downloadmethod' parameter with a setting of either 0 or 1,
% to change the order of tried download methods to prevent the downloader
% from getting stuck with a specific method in rare cases. Very
% infrequently, the download servers may be overloaded or down for
% maintenance, resulting in download failure. In that case, please retry a
% few hours later.
%
%
% The "targetRevision" argument is optional and should be normally omitted.
% Normal behaviour is to download the latest revision of Psychtoolbox.
% If you provide a specific targetRevision, then this script will
% install a copy of Psychtoolbox according to the specified revision.
%
% This is only useful if you experience problems and want
% to revert to an earlier known-to-be-good release.
%
% Revisions can be specified by a revision number, a specific date, or by
% the special flag 'PREV' which will choose the revision before the
% most current one.
%
%
% INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: The Wiki contains much more up to date
% instructions. If in doubt, follow instructions on the Wiki!
%
% 1. If you don't already have it, you must install the Subversion client.
% For Mac OSX, download the latest Mac OSX Subversion client from:
% web http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/
% (You can ignore the Subversion README file. If you do read it, you can
% skip the instruction to manually add /usr/local/bin to your unix path.
% That's tricky to do, and not needed for installation and updates because
% we always specify the full path.) Please note that OS/X 10.5 "Leopard"
% and later often come already with Subversion preinstalled, so you may
% be able to skip step 1.
%
% For Windows, download the Windows Subversion client from:
% web http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/34093/svn-1.4.0-setup.exe
% Install the Subversion client on your machine by double-clicking the
% installer and following the instructions. After installation of the
% Subversion client, you will need to exit and restart Matlab or Octave, so it
% can find the new subversion executable. In many cases it may be
% neccessary to even reboot your computer after installation of subversion.
% Btw. you should avoid to install the client into a path that contains
% blanks/spaces/white-space as this can lead to download failures in some
% cases, e.g., 'C:\Program Files\...' may be bad because there is a blank
% between the "Program" and "Files".
%
% Alternatively, if you don't have the neccessary permissions to install
% Subversion into a system folder, you can install Subversion into an
% arbitrary folder on your system (excluding ones with blanks in their
% path) and then add that folder to your Matlab or Octave path. E.g. you installed
% into D:\MyOwnFolder\Subversion\ . Then you can do this:
% addpath('D:\MyOwnFolder\Subversion\'). Our installer should find the
% client then.
%
% 2. On MacOS/X, to install the Psychtoolbox in the default location
% (/Applications or, failing that, /Users/Shared). Just type:
%
% DownloadPsychtoolbox
%
% Our standard option is in the Applications folder, but note that, as with
% installation of any software, you'll need administrator privileges. Also
% note that if you put the toolbox in the Applications folder, you'll need
% to reinstall it when MATLAB / OCTAVE is updated on your machine. If you must
% install without access to an administrator, we offer the option of
% installing into the /Users/Shared/ folder instead. If you must install
% the Psychtoolbox in some other folder, then specify it in the optional
% first argument of your call.
%
% On Windows or Linux, provide a pathname, e.g.:
% DownloadPsychtoolbox('C:\MyToolboxes\');
%
% That's it. Any pre-existing installation of the Psychtoolbox will be
% removed (if you approve). The program will then download the latest
% Psychtoolbox and update your MATLAB / OCTAVE path and other relevant system settings.
%
% Enjoy! If you're new to this, you might start by typing "help
% Psychtoolbox".
%
% P.S. If you get stuck, first check the FAQ section and Download section of
% our Wiki at http://www.psychtoolbox.org. If that doesn't help, post your
% question to the forum by email or web:
%
% web mailto:psychtoolbox@yahoogroups.com
% web http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/messages/
% web http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/post/
%
% Please specify your full name and the version of your operating system,
% MATLAB / OCTAVE, and psychtoolbox.
%
% UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS:
%
% To upgrade your copy of Psychtoolbox, at any time, to incorporate the
% latest bug fixes, enhancements, and new features, just type:
% UpdatePsychtoolbox
% 
% UpdatePsychtoolbox cannot change the flavor of your
% Psychtoolbox. To change the flavor, run DownloadPsychtoolbox to
% completely discard your old installation and get a fresh copy with the
% requested flavor.
% 
% PERMISSIONS:
%
% There's a thorny issue with permissions on OS/X. It may not be possible to
% install into /Applications (or whatever the targetdirectory is) with the
% user's existing privileges. The normal situation on Mac OSX is that a few
% users have "administrator" privileges, and many don't. By default,
% writing to the /Applications folder requires administrator privileges.
%
% Thus all OSX installers routinely demand an extra authorization (if
% needed), asking the user to type in the name and password of an
% administrator before proceeding. We haven't yet figured out how to do
% that, but we want to offer that option. This conforms to normal
% installation of an application under Mac OS X.
%
% DownloadPsychtoolbox creates the Psychtoolbox folder with permissions set
% to allow writing by everyone. Our hope is that this will allow updating
% (by UpdatePsychtoolbox) without need for administrator privileges.
%
% Some labs that may want to be able to install without access to an
% administrator. For them we offer the fall back of installing Psychtoolbox
% in /Users/Shared/, instead of /Applications/, because, by default,
% /Users/Shared/ is writeable by all users.
%
% SAVEPATH
%
% Normally all users of MATLAB / OCTAVE use the same path. This path is normally
% saved in MATLABROOT/toolbox/local/pathdef.m, where "MATLABROOT" stands
% for the result returned by running that function in MATLAB, e.g.
% '/Applications/MATLAB.app/Contents/Matlab14.1'. Since pathdef.m is inside
% the MATLAB package, which is normally in the Applications folder,
% ordinary users (not administrators) cannot write to pathdef.m. They'll
% get an error message whenever they try to save the path, e.g. by typing
% "savepath". Most users will find this an unacceptable limitation. The
% solution is very simple, ask an administrator to use File Get Info to set
% the pathdef.m file permissions to allow write by everyone. This needs to
% be done only once, after installing MATLAB.

% History:
%
% 11/02/05 mk  Created.
% 11/25/05 mk  Bug fix for 'targetdirectory' provided by David Fencsik.
% 01/13/06 mk  Added support for download of Windows OpenGL-PTB.
% 03/10/06 dgp Expanded the help text, above, incorporating suggestions
%              from Daniel Shima.
% 03/11/06 dgp Check OS. Remove old Psychtoolbox from path and from disk.
%              After downloading, add new Psychtoolbox to path.
% 03/12/06 dgp Polished error message regarding missing svn.
% 03/13/06 dgp Changed default targetdirectory from PWD to ~/Documents/.
% 03/14/06 dgp Changed default targetdirectory to /Applications/, and
%              if not sufficiently privileged, then /Users/Shared/.
%              Check privilege to create folder. Check SAVEPATH.
% 06/05/06 mk  On Windows, we require the user to pass the full path to
%              the installation folder, because there is no well-defined
%              equivalent to the Mac OS X /Applications/ folder. Also, the order
%              of operations was changed to maximize the chance of getting a
%              working PTB installation despite minor failures of commands
%              like savepath, or fileattrib. We allow the user to decide
%              whether to delete her old Psychtoolbox folders or to
%              retain multiple copies of Psychtoolbox (e.g., beta and stable)
%              so each user can choose between Beta and Stable.
%              We no longer copy UpdatePsychtoolbox.m, since it's included in the 
%              new Psychtoolbox folder 
% 06/06/06 dgp Cosmetic editing of comments, above.
% 06/27/06 dgp Cosmetic editing of comments and messages. Check for spaces
%              in targetdirectory name.
% 9/23/06  mk  Add clear mex call to flush mex files before downloading.
% 10/5/06  mk  Add detection code for MacOS-X on Intel Macs.
% 10/28/06 dhb Allow 'current' as a synonym for 'beta'.
% 11/21/06 mk  Allow alternate install location for svn client: Installer
%              will find the svn executable if its installation folder is
%              included in the Matlab path.
% 02/17/07 mk  Convert flavor spec to lower case in case it isn't.
% 03/15/07 mk  Detection code for Windows 64 bit added.
% 07/18/07 mk  Changed default for flavor from 'stable' to 'beta'.
% 09/27/07 mk  Add another fallback path: Download via https protocol to
%              maybe bypass proxy-servers.
% 10/29/07 mk  Small fix for Kerstin Preuschoffs bugreport: Download of old
%              versions didn't work anymore, becuase 'flavor' string was
%              lower-cased.
% 11/17/07 mk  Prioritized https:// checkout over http:// checkout --> More
%              likely to bypass proxy servers and succeed.
% 12/25/07 mk  Add check for white spaces in path to subversion client - Output warning, if so.
% 12/25/07 mk  Add optional 'downloadmethod' parameter, which allows to
%              select initial choie of download protocol to use, in order to allow to
%              bypass misconfigured proxies and firewalls. Problem reported
%              by Patrick Mineault.
% 01/08/08 mk  On OS/X, add an additional search path for 'svn': /usr/bin/
%              as per suggestion of Donald Kalar. Presumably, Apples Leopard ships
%              with a svn client preinstalled in that location.
%
% 05/07/08 mk  Add better handling of default values. Add 'targetRevision'
%              parameter as option, just as in UpdatePsychtoolbox.m
%
% 06/16/08 mk  Change default initial download protcol from svn: to https:,
%              as Berlios seems to have disabled svnserve protocol :-(
%
% 10/01/08 mk  Add interactive output/query for svn client on the Unices.
%              This to work-around questions of the client about accepting
%              security certificates...
% 01/05/09 mk  Remove && or || to make old Matlab versions happier.
% 01/05/09 mk  Remove && or || to make old Matlab versions happier.
% 01/05/09 mk  Change order of call arguments to make choice of default
%              'beta' flavor more convenient and choice of 'stable'
%              inconvenient. Also add some additional warning text and
%              dialog to tell user how bad 'stable' is and to give him a
%              chance to reconsider.
% 03/22/09 mk  Update help text again. Rename 'stable' into 'unsupported'.
% 05/31/09 mk  Add support for Octave-3.
% 10/05/09 mk  Strip trailing fileseperator from targetDirectory, as
%              suggested by Erik Flister to avoid trouble with new svn
%              clients.
% 12/27/10 mk  Redirect 'beta' downloads on Matlab versions < 6.5 to the
%              special "Psychtoolbox-3.0.8-PreMatlab6.5" compatibility
%              version - The last one to support pre 6.5 Matlab's.
%
% 10/31/11 mk  Change location of SVN repository to
%              http://psychtoolbox-3.googlecode.com/svn/
%              our new home, now that Berlios is shutting down.
%
% 05/30/12 mk  Fix disasterous bug: Answering anything but 'y' to the
%              question if old PTB folder should be deleted, caused
%              *deletion* of the folder! Oh dear! This bug present since
%              late 2011.
