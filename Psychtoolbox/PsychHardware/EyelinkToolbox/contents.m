% 	EyelinkToolbox.% 	Version 1.4.4 		      27-11-02% % 	The EyelinkToolbox is a collection of m-files and a Mex file that%	can be used to control the SR research-Eyelink© gazetracker.%%   EYELINK is a MEX/DLL file, which can be used as an interface between the eyelink%   and matlab. The EyelinkToolbox uses the same approach as the SCREEN mex/dll function%	provided in the PsychToolBox (http://www.psychtoolbox.org/) and also uses the%	functions provided by this toolbox for doing any graphics involved (so you need to%	install the PsychToolbox for the EyelinkToolbox to function properly).%%	We greatly appreciate the effort David Brainard and Denis Pelli have undertaken%	in making the PsychToolBox. We have further benefitted from the experience of% 	Jos van der Geest and Maarten Frens.%%	Note that this toolbox is NOT provided nor endorsed by SR-Research%	(http://www.eyelinkinfo.com/), the supplier of the Eyelink gazetracker, so do not contact%	them about this. Rather, post questions on the PsychToolbox mailinglist, or directly to us.%	If you're interested in the c-source code of this project, we will be%	glad to send it to you.%	%	Disclaimer: we cannot be hold responsible for any damage that may (appear to) be%				caused by the use of this toolbox. Use at your own risc.%%   Most of the Eyelink functions that are avaible in C are now also available%	under Matlab. If any particular function you need is still missing, let us know%	and we'll try to incorporate it into a next release. In case you decide to add%	or modify functions yourself, please send us the modified code.% 	If you think you've found a bug, please tell us: f.w.cornelissen@med.rug.nl% 	It will help greatly if you can supply a  minimal-length program that exhibits % 	the bug.%%   For a complete list of available functions type "EYELINK" in the matlab command window%   For an explanation of any particular eyelink function just add a%   question mark "?" after a command.% 	E.g. for 'Initialize', try either of these equivalent forms:% 		EYELINK('Initialize?')% 		EYELINK initialize?%% 	[optional arguments]:% 	Brackets in the function list, e.g. [remport], indicate optional arguments, not% 	matrices. Optional arguments must be in order, without omitting earlier ones.% 	%%	Contents of the EyelinkToolbox folder:%	-Contents.m: this file.%	-Changes.m: documents changes%	-EyelinkBasic%		EYELINK.mex file and a collection of m-files%	-EyelinkDemos%		-Short demo: file 'eyelinkexample.m'%						Shows a simple gaze cursor. Blinking erases the screen.%						simple demo program to illustrating the use of this %						toolbox. Note that it uses the 'dotrackersetup' contained%						within the mex file, rather then the m-file based version.%		-EyelinkDemoExperiment: 'eyelinkdemoexp.m': a simple demo experiment%						with the flavour of the c-coded demo experiment of Dave Stampe '97.%						there are two (types of) trials:%							simpletrialdemo: a simple gaze recording example%							realtimedemo: a simple gaze-dependent display example%		-Palmer demo: Simple experiment to measure response time using eye movements.%%	-EyelinkSounds: a few sounds that you can add to your system to recreate%						that particular Eyelink Mac-experience.%						On a Mac, add the sounds to your system by dragging%						the sound files this folder onto your closed system folder.%						You can't have any programs open when copying sound%						resources to your system.%						use 'testeyelinksounds' to test for the presence of all required sounds%%	-EyelinkTests: %			-testgetkeyforeyelink.m : %						Function that tests the getkeyforeyelink routine and%						computes the time taken by the getkeyforeyelink function call%			-testcalls.m%						Program that tests if most of the eyelink routines are operational, %						also useful as illustration of the eyelink function calls(no calibration).%			-testcalib.m :%						Tests and illustrates the eyelink calibration routine.%						%			-testsampletime.m :%						Program which performs multiple timing-tests on functions related%						to sampling eye position.% 			-EXGetEyeLinkTime.m% 						tests the new requesttime and readtime functions.					% 			-testbutton.m% 						test of the new buttonstates and lastbuttonpress functions. %%	Some things to observe before using the toolbox:% 	*Software used to produce and test the code. % 	Macintosh version%		Mac OS 9.1.%		C-compiler: CodeWarrior 6.1.%		Matlab 5.2.1%		Operator PC: EyeLink 2.04%		PsychToolbox 2.5.2 + screen 2.5.3%% 	PC version% 		Windows 98 & XP (XP tested in dummy mode)% 		C-compiler: MS Visual C% 		Matlab 6.1% 		PsychToolbox 2.5.0% %  *The EyelinkToolbox folder can be put anywhere on your harddisk as long as you make%	sure that Matlab knows about it's existence. So use the 'set path' command under the%	file menu. You only need to add the 'EyelinkToolbox' folder%	*The sounds the EYELINK toolbox uses as well as many other defaults need% 	to be included in your system folder, otherwise (some of) the demo's will stop.% 	Use 'testeyelinksounds.m' to see if the necessary sounds are present%	*Currently, for the mac, there are both m-file as well as mex-file implementations of dotrackersetup,%	and dodriftcorrection. If there are no problems with timing, it is our%	idea to enable only the m-file versions in a more final release. The great advantage%	of using only m-files is that this makes the code much more portable and flexible to use.%	*we have not done any exhaustive testing on the timing of this toolbox, so do not%	assume that things are as they used to be with the pure c-code versions of your experiments.%	*The current version is Powermac only. While we do have the intention to port the mex-code to%	the windows version, this currently has no great priority for us.%	We welcome any observations, suggestions that may help us improve this toolbox.%%	Enno Peters, Frans Cornelissen and John Palmer%	Groningen, 27-11-2002%	email: f.w.cornelissen@med.rug.nl%% 	Copyright (c) 2001, 2002 by Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology, University of Groningen%%%%%%
