% CMUBox - Access CMU response button box or PST serial response button box as well as fORP and Bitwhacker devices.
% 
%
% This allows to query button response boxes of type CMU (Carnegie Mellon
% University box) and PST (E-Prime response box). It also allows to use a
% UBW32/Bitwhacker device to be used as a response box if the device is
% loaded with the StickOS firmware from http://cpustick.com. It also allows
% to use the Curdes fORP devices if connected via serial port. And it offers
% a simple way to access the RTBox in E-Prime mode.
%
% Commands and their syntax:
% --------------------------
%
% handle = CMUBox('Open', boxtype [, portName] [, options] [, debounceSecs=0.030] [, isInverted]);
% - Open response box connected to serial port 'portName', or the first
% serial port found, if 'portName' is omitted. Initialize it, return a
% 'handle' to it. You'll have to pass 'handle' to all following functions
% to access the box.
%
% If your system has multiple devices connected to multiple serial ports
% then you should explicitely specify the 'portName', otherwise the driver
% may connect to the wrong port and choke!
%
% The optional string parameter 'options' allows to tweak the behaviour of
% the driver for certain configurations. It supports the following options:
%
% 'ftdi' - Tells the driver that it is connecting to a Serial-over-USB port
% and that the converter/driver is from FTDI Inc., or a compatible device.
% Allows for certain optimizations in timing accuracy.
%
% 'norelease' - Tells the driver it shouldn't report button release / TTL
% transition to low events, but only button presses and TTL onsets.
%
%
% The optional parameter 'debounceSecs' sets the debounce interval for
% button debouncing if the Bitwhacker is used as response box. After a
% button press, the device will wait for all the buttons to be released for
% at least 'debounceSecs' seconds. Only then will it accept new button
% presses. The default setting is 30 msecs if this option is omitted.
%
%
% The optional parameter vector 'isInverted' defines whether a TTL input
% signal level of logic low (0) corresponds to a button press or a button
% release. By default, a level of logic low is detected as button press.The
% vector has nine elements, one for each corresponding input line. If an
% element is 1, then a logic level of low is registered as a button press.
% A value of 0 means that a logic level of high is registered as a button
% press. E.g., isInverted = [ 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 ] would register a logic
% level of low as a button press on the first four inputs, whereas a level
% of high is required to detect a button press on the last five inputs. 
% 
%
% The mandatory parameter 'boxtype' is a name string defining the
% type/model of box to connnect to. Supported settings are:
%
% 'bitwhacker' - Connect to UBW32/Bitwhacker with StickOS Firmware,
% reconfigure it to impersonate a response box.
%
% 'cmu' - Connect to CMU serial port response button box, assuming 19.2
% KBaud datarate, 8 databits, 1 stop bit, odd parity.
%
% 'pst' - Connect to PST serial port response button box in E-Prime
% configuration with 800 streaming samples per second at 19200 Baud, 8
% databits, 1 stopbit, no parity. Please note this is our expectation: If
% the box is configured for something else than 19200 Baud, we will fail or
% hang. If 1600 samples/sec are configured instead of 800 sampes/sec, we
% won't care, but timing might be less accurate due to the too high USB load,
% unless we're running on a real serial port which shouldn't have a
% problem with 1600 samples/sec. Serial-over-USB however will likely choke!
% Verify that the DIP switches or jumpers inside the box are properly set
% up.
%
% 'forpserial-1' - Connect to a fORP interface unit type FIU-005 on the
% serial port, configured with a program switch setting of 1. This is
% exactly the same as a PST box running with 800 Samples/Sec streaming
% rate.
%
% 'forpserial-0', 'forpserial-2', 'forpserial-4', 'forpserial-6'
% Connect to a fORP interface unit type FIU-005 on the serial port,
% configured with a program switch setting of 0, 2, 4 or 6. In this mode,
% similar to the Bitwhacker, the device will only send a single byte if the
% status of the buttons or triggers changes. This is more efficient than
% mode 'forpserial-1', so one of these settings is recommended.
%
% Modes 0, 4 and 6 will only report button presses or trigger reception,
% but not button releases, whereas mode 2 will report any status change,
% ie., it will also report and timestamp button releases. The mapping of
% the returned status value to corresponding button / trigger states is
% dependent on the selected mode. Modes 0, 4 and 6 report ASCII codes that
% identify the pressed button, whereas mode 2 returns a status byte where
% each bit encodes the current (updated) status of a single button, similar
% to the PST and CMU response boxes. For the specifics, see the fORP manual
% at http://www.curdes.com/ForpUserGuide.html
%
% 'rtbox' - Connect to a RTBox in "simple mode", the mode it uses after
% powerup. The Box will send a byte of data for each event, each bit encoding
% the new status of one button or other input.
%
% 'lumina' - Connect to a Cedrus Lumina response box.
%
%
% CMUBox('Close', handle);
% - Close connection to response box 'handle'. The 'handle' is invalid
% thereafter.
%
%
% evt = CMUBox('GetEvent', handle [, waitForEvent=0]);
% - Retrieve next queued event received from the box in the struct 'evt'.
% If no new events are available and the optional 'waitForEvent' is set to
% 1, then the function will wait until at least one valid event becomes
% available and return that event. Otherwise it will return an empty struct,
% ie., evt = [] to signal that no new events are available.
%
% The following subfields are available in 'evt' if 'evt' is non-empty:
%
% evt.state = 1 Byte value which encodes the new status of the response
% buttons and input lines of the box. A 1-bit means button pressed/signal
% active. A 0-bit means button released/signal inactive. See the
% documentation of your box for meaning of the single bits. If you use the
% Bitwhacker then evt.state does directly encode the button number of a
% pressed button: 0 == All buttons released and all TTL inputs low.
% Values 1-7 correspond to a low->high transition of TTL input pins A1 - A7.
% Values 8 and 9 correspond to a button press of onboard buttons "USER" or
% "PRG". Bitwhacker can only report one active button or TTL line at a time.
%
% The fORP device will encode evt.state differently depending on selected
% mode, either like a Bitwhacker device or like a CMU/PST response box.
%
% evt.time  = Psychtoolbox GetSecs() timestamp of the time when the event
% was received from the box. The accuracy depends on the properties of your
% serial port device and system load. For a native serial port and a
% normally loaded system, you can expect about 1-2 msec delay. For a
% Serial-over-USB port, it depends on the converter type and driver
% settings but can be 2-3 msecs at best.
%
% evt.trouble = If zero, then evt is probably valid and good. If non-zero,
% then the timestamp is likely screwed and useless, as are probably all
% following timestamps, at least for CMU/PST boxes and fORP's in mode 1!
% For the Bitwhacker or fORP's in modes 0,2,4 or 6, only the current 'evt'
% will be invalid, but later events will recover and thereby be unaffected.
%
%
% status = CMUBox('Status', handle);
% - Retrieve internal status of response box 'handle' as a struct.

% How to setup latency timer and eventChar under Linux for FTDI
% USB-Serial converters?
%
% Example for Ubuntu Linux 7.1 with first serial converter device ttyUSB0:
%
% su + Superuser password.
% cd /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0
%
% Set event character:
%
% echo X > event_char
% with X being 0 to disable event character, or 256 + ASCII code of
% event character, e.g., echo 256 > event_char for ASCII code 0, or
% echo 266 > event_char for ASCII code 10, because 266 = 256 + 10.
%
% Set latency timer to 1 millisecond: (Default is 16 msecs)
% echo 1 > latency_timer
%
% Query current latency timer setting:
% cat latency_timer
