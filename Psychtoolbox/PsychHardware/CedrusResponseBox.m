function varargout = CedrusResponseBox(cmd, varargin)
% CedrusResponseBox - Interface to Cedrus Response Boxes.
%
% This function provides an interface to response button boxes from Cedrus,
% specifically model RB 530,...,830 and compatible models supporting the
% XID protocol (see http://www.cedrus.com).
%
% These response boxes connect via a serial line link interface, or a USB
% interface which emulates a serial link interface. They support the XID
% protocol for communication. See http://www.cedrus.com/xid for details.
%
% This function allows to establish a connection to the box, control a few
% of its parameters and most importantly query its button state and
% associated button press timestamps.
%
% It supports multiple subcommands, which accept and return different
% arguments, as listed below.
%
% Limitations:
% ------------
%
% Functionality is currently limited mostly to button queries (and RJ-45
% connector state queries), including timestamps, as well as control of
% built-in timers of the box. We also support basic configuration of TTL
% ports, but not yet all settings of the box like e.g., button debounce
% time. Adding such calls is straightforward and simple.
%
% We found communication with the Cedrus boxes to be unreliable quite
% often. It is an open question if this is a flaw in the design of the
% Cedrus devices and their firmware or protocols, or if the programming
% documentation for them is incomplete and therefore our implementation of
% the driver. However, the problems were reproduced under different
% operating systems, serial port drivers, toolboxes by different
% implementations written by different people, so it doesn't seem to be a
% simple glitch in one implementation. In general, the boxes work, but
% don't be surprised if you need to restart your script multiple times
% before you can establish communication, or if the more advanced
% fucntions, e.g., for configuration of the TTL RJ-45 connector, work
% unreliably for no apparent reason. Cedrus has been contacted, but so far
% no resolution or response from them.
%
% In short: If you are looking for a reliable response box that is painfree
% to use, don't buy Cedrus devices!
%
%
% Subfunctions and their meaning:
% -------------------------------
%
% Functions for device init and shutdown: Call once at beginning/end of
% your script. These are slow!
%
% handle = CedrusResponseBox('Open', port [, lowbaudrate]);
% - Open a compatible response box which is connected to the given named
% serial 'port'. 'port'names differ accross operating systems. A typical
% port name for Windows would be 'COM2', whereas a typical port name on OS/X
% or Linux would be the name of a serial port device file, e.g.,
% '/dev/cu.usbserial-FTDI125ZX9' on OS/X, or '/dev/ttyS0' on Linux.
%
% All names on OS/X are like '/dev/cu.XXXXX', where the XXXXX part depends
% on your serial port device, typically '/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXXX' for
% serial over USB devices with product name XXXXX.
%
% On Linux, all names are of pattern '/dev/ttySxx' for standard serial
% ports, e.g., '/dev/ttyS0' for the first serial port in the system, and of
% type '/dev/ttyUSBxx' for serial over USB devices, e.g., '/dev/ttyUSB0'
% for the first serial line emulated over the USB protocol.
%
%
% After the connection is established and some testing and initialization is,
% done, the function returns a device 'handle', a unique identifier to use
% for all other subfunctions.
%
% By default the commlink is opened at a baud transmission rate of 115200
% Baud (All DIP switches on the box need to be in 'down' position!). If you
% specify the optional flag 'lowbaudrate' as 1, then the speed will be
% lowered to 56 kBaud at device open time -- in case your system works
% unreliably at the higher rate.
%
% By default, the script uses Psychtoolbox's own IOPort() serial link
% driver for communication (ptb_cedrus_drivertype = 2). If you want to use
% a different driver for testing, change the 'ptb_cedrus_drivertype'
% parameter inside the code with the id of a supported driver (Matlab
% serial() on Windows and Linux, SerialComm on OS/X). This option may go
% away in the future and is for debugging only!
%
%
% CedrusResponseBox('Close', handle);
% - Close connection to response box. The 'handle' becomes invalid after
% that command.
%
%
% CedrusResponseBox('CloseAll');
% - Close all connections to all response boxes. This is a convenience
% function for quick shutdown.
%
%
% dev = CedrusResponseBox('GetDeviceInfo', handle);
% - Return queried information about the device in a struct 'dev'. 'dev'
% contains (amongst other) the following fields:
%
% General information:
%  dev.Name = Device name string.
%  dev.VersionMajor and dev.VersionMinor = Major and Minor firmware revision.
%  dev.productId = Type of device, e.g., 'Lumina', 'VoiceKey' or 'RB response pad'.
%  dev.modelId   = Submodel of the device if the device is a RB response pad,
%                  e.g., 'RB-530', 'RB-730', 'RB-830' or 'RB-834'.
%
%  dev.port      = Portname of serial port, as passed to the open function.
%
% Diagnostic information for timing: Values of -1 or 0 usually mean "info
% not available".
%
%  dev.roundtriptime   = Median of estimated roundtrip latency for
%                        communication with the box - in seconds.
%
%  dev.roundtripstddev = Standard deviation from mean of roundtrip latency
%  measurements in seconds. Large numbers mean that your operating system
%  has bad scheduling and that reported event timestamps may be uncertain by
%  that amount.
%
%  dev.rttresetdelay   = Duration (in seconds) of a reaction time timer reset sequence
%  Values of more than 3 msecs indicate some problems with the box itself or
%  the communication link -- Measured event times or reaction times may not
%  be trustworthy!
%
%
% Functions for use within script. These are as fast as possible:
%
% CedrusResponseBox('ClearQueues', handle);
% - Clear all queues, discard all pending data.
%
% [status = ] CedrusResponseBox('FlushEvents', handle);
% - Empty/clear/flush the queue of pending events. Use this to get rid of
% any stale button press or release events before start of response
% collection in a trial. E.g., Assume you wait for a subjects keypress and
% finally receive that keypress via 'GetButtons' or 'WaitButtons'. You
% collected your response, the trial is done, but when the subject releases
% the button again, that will generate another event - a release event, in
% which you're not interested. Maybe the subject will accidentally hit the
% button as well. --> Good to clean the queue before a new trial.
%
% This function has a second use as well. It has an optional output
% argument, 'status', which will return the current status of all buttons
% (i.e. whether they are currently being pressed or not).
% Status is a 3 row by 8 column matrix: Row 1 describes the status of the
% up to eight pushbuttons of the box. Row 2 describes the status of the TTL
% lines of the RJ-45 accessory connector. Row 3 describes the status of the
% VoiceKey if any. Columns 1 to 8 of each row correspond to buttons 1-8,
% TTL lines 1-8 or inputs 1-8 of the VoiceKey.
%
% The mapping for the CB-530 for row 1 of 'status' status(1,:) is as follows:
%
% [top ??? left middle right bottom] -- the 2nd entry has no associated
% button, but it may be the scanner trigger input. The mapping on other boxes
% may be different.
%
% This is useful if you just want to know whether the subject is currently
% pressing any buttons before you proceed, but are not fussed about timing.
%
% E.g. I often find myself doing the following:
%   buttons = 1;
%   while any(buttons(1,:))
%     buttons = CedrusResponseBox('FlushEvents', mybox);
%   end
%
% ...to wait for the subject to release any buttons which might currently be down.
%
% evt = CedrusResponseBox('GetButtons', handle);
% - Return next queued button-press or button-release event from the box.
% Each time a button on the box is pressed or released, and each time the
% state of the accessory connector changes, an "event" data packet is sent
% from the box to the computer. The packet is timestamped with the time of
% the triggering event, as measured by the boxes reaction time timer.
%
% This function checks if such an event is available and returns its
% description in a 'evt' struct, if so. If no event is pending, it returns an
% empty 'evt', ie. isempty(evt) is true.
%
% 'evt' for a real fetched event is a struct with the following fields:
%
% evt.raw     = "raw" byte that describes the event. Only for debugging.
%
% evt.port    = Number of the device port on which the event occured. Push
%               buttons and scanner triggers are on port 0, the RJ-45 TTL
%               connector is on port 1, port 2 is the voice-key (if any).
%
% evt.action  = Action that triggered the event:
%               1 = Button press, 0 = Button release for pushbuttons.
%               1 = TTL line high, 0 = TTL line low for RJ-45 I/O lines.
%               1 = Voice onse, 0 = Voice offset/silence for Voicekey.
%
% evt.button  = Number of the button that was pressed or released (1 to 8)
%               or the TTL line that was going high/low. Numbers vary by
%               response box.
%
% evt.buttonID= Descriptive name string for pressed button, e.g., 'top' or
%               'left'. Please note that this mapping is only meaningful
%               for the RB-530 response box.
%
% evt.rawtime = Time of the event in secs since last reset of the reaction
%               time timer, measured in msecs resolution. This value is
%               always valid, but not directly comparable to any other
%               timestamps or time measurements within Psychtoolbox.
%
%
% evt = CedrusResponseBox('WaitButtons', handle);
% - Queries and returns the same info as 'GetButtons', but waits for
% events. If there isn't any event available, will wait until one becomes
% available.
%
% evt = CedrusResponseBox('WaitButtonPress', handle);
% - Like WaitButtons, but will wait until the subject /presses/ a key -- the
% signal that a key has been released is not acceptable -- Button release
% events are simply discarded.
%
%
% evt = CedrusResponseBox('GetBaseTimer', handle [, nSamples=1]);
% - Query current time of base timer of the box. Returned values are in
% seconds, resolution is milliseconds. evt.basetimer is the timers time,
% maybe corrected for serial link receive latency. evt.ptbreceivetime is a
% timestamp taken via PTB's GetSecs() at time of receive of the data.
% evt.ptbtime is the basetimers time mapped into PTB GetSecs time if such a
% mapping is possible, otherwise this field doesn't exist:
% evt.ptbreceivetime and evt.ptbtime shouldn't be significantly different
% if everything is good. Large differences indicate some timing problems
% with the connection to the box, or a timer problem - either with your
% computers timer or the hardware timer of the tox, or significant
% clock-drift between the computers timer and the boxes timer. In any case,
% reaction timer measurements and such will be problematic.
%
% Note that this automatically discards all pending events in the queue before
% performing the timer query!
%
% The optional argument 'nSamples' allows to specify if multiple samples of
% PTB timer vs. the response boxes timer should be measured. If 'nSamples'
% is set to a value greater than one, a cell array with nSamples elements
% will be returned, each corresponding to one measurement. This allows,
% e.g., to check if PTBs timer and the boxes timer drift against each
% other.
%
%
% resetTime = CedrusResponseBox('ResetRTTimer', handle);
% - Reset reaction time timer of box to zero. This should not be neccessary
% if you use the evt.ptbtime timestamps for time measurements or reaction
% time measurements. If you however use uncalibrated mode and the
% evt.rawtime values directly, this function may be useful to establish a
% zero baseline for reaction time measurements. However, as the communication
% delay for sending the reset command can't be reliably measured, using
% such a software triggered timer reset may not be the most reliable way of
% resetting the timer. The function returns 'resetTime' PTB's best guess of
% when the reset was carried out -- essentially a GetSecs() timestamp of
% when the reset command was sent.
%
% Note that this automatically discards all pending
% events in the queue before performing the query!
%
%
% slope = CedrusResponseBox('GetBoxTimerSlope', handle);
% - Compute slope (drift) between computer clock and device clock. 'slope'
% tells how many seconds of time "elapse" on the computer in GetSecs time
% for each "elapsed" second of box time. At device open time, the driver
% takes a timestamp from the device basetimer. This function also takes a
% timestamp and then computes the ratio of differences. The longer you'll
% wait after CedrusResponseBox('Open') before calling this function, the
% more accurate the clock-drift estimate will be.
%
%
% roundtrip = CedrusResponseBox('RoundTripTest', handle);
% - Initiate 100 trials of the roundtrip test of the box. Data is echoed
% forth and back 100 times between PTB and the box, and the latency is
% measured (in seconds, with msecs resolution). The vector of all samples
% is returned in 'roundtrip' for evaluation and debugging. The measured
% latency is also used for delay correction for the 'GetBaseTimer'
% subfunction. However, a roundtrip test is performed automatically when
% opening the response box connection, so this is rarely needed.
%
% Note that this automatically discards all pending
% events in the queue before performing the query!
%
%
% [currentMode] = CedrusResponseBox('SetConnectorMode', handle [, mode]);
% - Set or get mode of operation of external accessory connector: 'mode' can be
% any of the following text strings:
%
% 'GeneralPurpose': Input/Output assignment of pins can be freely
% programmed via the 'DefineInputLinesAndLevels' subcommand (see below),
% and the output lines only change if the 'SetOutputLineLevels' command
% (see below) is used. The connector doesn't change state by itself.
%
% 'ReflectiveContinuous': Line levels reflect button state: Line is active
% if button is pressed and goes inactive when the button is released again.
%
% 'ReflectiveSinglePulse': A single pulse is sent to an output line if a
% button is pressed on the box. Nothing is sent on release.
%
% 'ReflectiveDoublePulse': A single pulse is sent to an output line if a
% button is pressed on the box. Another pulse is sent on button release.
%
% If 'mode' is left out, the function queries and returns the current mode
% as return argument 'currentMode'. If mode is given, nothing is returned.
%
%
% CedrusResponseBox('SetOutputLineLevels', handle, outlevels);
% - Set accessory connector output lines to state specified in 'outlevels'.
% outlevels is an 8 element vector of zeros and ones. Each element
% corresponds to an output pin, and its values sets the output level of
% that pin. Example: outlevel = [1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] would set the 4 lines
% with the lowest numbers (lines 0,1,2,3) to '1' aka active and the 4 lines
% with the highest numbers (lines 4,5,6,7) to '0' aka inactive.
% This corresponds to XiD command 'ah'.
%
% The command is only effective if connector is set to 'GeneralPurpose'.
%
%
% CedrusResponseBox('DefineInputLinesAndLevels', handle, inputlines, logiclevel, debouncetime);
% - Define which lines on the connector are inputs: 'inputlines' is a
% vector with the line numbers of the input lines. All other lines are
% designated as output lines, e.g., inputlines = [0, 2, 4] would set lines
% 0, 2 and 4 as inputs, remaining lines 1,3,5,6,7 as outputs. 'logiclevel'
% tells if the default TTL level of the input lines is low (logiclevel=1)
% or high (logiclevel=0). Example: logiclevel = 1 means that the lines are
% pulled low by default, so they will detect an active high state -- if
% their level is raised to TTL high state. The argument 'debouncetime' must
% be the debounce time for the input lines in milliseconds. After an event
% on a input line, the box will ignore all further events on than input
% line for 'debouncetime' milliseconds.
%
% This corresponds to XiD commands 'a4', 'a50' and 'a51', as well as 'a6'.
%
% The command is only effective if connector is set to 'GeneralPurpose'.
%
%
% inputLines = CedrusResponseBox('ReadInputLines', handle);
% - Read current state of the connectors input lines: Returns an 8 element
% vector where each element corresponds to one input line and a 1 means
% active, 0 means inactive. This corresponds to XiD command 'ar'.
%
% Note that this automatically discards all pending
% events in the queue before performing the query!
%
% The command is only effective if connector is set to 'GeneralPurpose'.

% [,doCalibrate=0]
% If you don't specify the optional 'doCalibrate' flag, or
% leave it at its default setting of 1, a couple of lengthy (multiple
% seconds) timing calibrations and tests are performed. These allow to
% assess the delays in communication between box and Matlab. They will also
% allow to return all times of events (as detected by the box) in PTB's
% standard GetSecs() time reference system -- Timestamps of button press
% events and TTL input events can be directly compared with timestamps
% delivered by other PTB functions like GetSecs, KbCheck, KbWait,
% Screen('Flip') etc.
%
% If you set the 'doCalibrate' flag to zero, all timing calibrations will
% be skipped: Startup time is drastically reduced. However there isn't any
% simple and straightforward way of comparing timestamps or timer readings
% delivered by the box with other timestamps of PTB functions. This only
% makes sense if you use some external triggering mechanism to reset the
% built-in reaction time timer via some external TTL input trigger signals
% and want to use raw timer measurements.

% evt.ptbtime = Time of the event in secs, measured in PTBs "GetSecs"
%               timebase. This is easier to correlate with other
%               timestamps, e.g., Screen('Flip') timestamps, but its
%               reliability hasn't been tested yet for the current
%               software release. When opening a connection to a response
%               box, we perform timing calibrations to establish the
%               mapping of time values as measured by the hardware timers
%               of your response pad to time values in PTB's reference
%               system. If you skipped that calibrations by setting the
%               optional 'doCalibrate' flag to zero at device open time,
%               then the evt.ptbtime field will not be available and you
%               have to cope with evt.rawtime values only.
