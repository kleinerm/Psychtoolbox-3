How to cable to the PR-650

The CMETER routine is written to send signals out the Modem port on the
Macintosh to the PhotoResearch P5-650 spectral radiometer.

The modem port takes an 8 pin male plug.  Orient the plug sothat you see
three horizontal rows of pins with two pins in the top row, three in the
middle row, and three in the bottom row.  The pins are then numbered 1-8
going across each rows and then down through the rows.  (So pin 1 is the
upper left, pin 2 the upper right, pin 3 the middle left, etc.)  See
Guide to the Macintosh Family Hardware , p. 360 for a picture of the
pin-out.

The PR-650 comes with an interface cable that ends in a standard female
DB-25 connector.  If you look into the male connector that will plug
into the 650 with the long row of pins on top, then the top row is
numbered 1-13 from left to right and the bottom row is numbered 14-25.

To get CMETER to work, you need to connect as follows

Mac Pin				DB-25 Pin

1									20
2									4
3									3
4									7
5									2
6									7				(I'm not sure this is necessary)
7									open
8									open

You can buy cables that plug into the modem port on one end and has a
DB-25 connector on the other.  What pin is connected to what varies
depending on who made the cable.  I suggest you get one, measure its
connectivity, and then build a cross-over cable to get the desired
overall effect.  (That is what we did.)

The PR-650 cable has a little switch on it with two positions, xfer and
ctrll.  The switch should be set to ctrlr.
