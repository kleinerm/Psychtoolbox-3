% PsychOculusVR - A high level driver for Oculus VR hardware.
%
% Note: If you want to write VR code that is portable across
% VR headsets of different vendors, then use the PsychVRHMD()
% driver instead of this driver. The PsychVRHMD driver will use
% this driver as appropriate when connecting to a Oculus Rift
% or similar Oculus device, but it will also automaticaly work
% with other head mounted displays. This driver does however
% expose a few functions specific to Oculus hardware, so you can
% mix calls to this driver with calls to PsychVRHMD to do some
% mix & match.
%
% For setup instructions for Oculus HMDs see "help OculusVR".
%
%
% Usage:
%
% hmd = PsychOculusVR('AutoSetupHMD' [, basicTask='Tracked3DVR'][, basicRequirements][, basicQuality=0][, deviceIndex]);
% - Open a Oculus HMD, set it up with good default rendering and
% display parameters and generate a PsychImaging('AddTask', ...)
% line to setup the Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline for proper display
% on the HMD. This will also cause the device connection to get
% auto-closed as soon as the onscreen window which displays on
% the HMD is closed. Returns the 'hmd' handle of the HMD on success.
%
% By default, the first detected HMD will be used and if no VR HMD
% is connected, it will open an emulated/simulated one for basic
% testing and debugging. You can override this default choice of
% HMD by specifying the optional 'deviceIndex' parameter to choose
% a specific HMD.
%
% More optional parameters: 'basicTask' what kind of task should be implemented.
% The default is 'Tracked3DVR', which means to setup for stereoscopic 3D
% rendering, driven by head motion tracking, for a fully immersive experience
% in some kind of 3D virtual world. This is the default if omitted. The task
% 'Stereoscopic' sets up for display of stereoscopic stimuli, but without
% head tracking. 'Monoscopic' sets up for display of monocular stimuli, ie.
% the HMD is just used as a special kind of standard display monitor.
%
% 'basicRequirements' defines basic requirements for the task. Currently
% defined are the following strings which can be combined into a single
% 'basicRequirements' string: 'LowPersistence' = Try to keep exposure
% time of visual images on the retina low if possible, ie., try to approximate
% a pulse-type display instead of a hold-type display if possible. This has
% no effect on the Rift DK1. On the Rift DK2 it will enable low persistence
% scanning of the OLED display panel, to light up each pixel only a fraction
% of a video refresh cycle duration.
%
% 'FastResponse' = Try to switch images with minimal delay and fast
% pixel switching time. This will enable OLED panel overdrive processing
% on the Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2. OLED panel overdrive processing is a
% relatively expensive post processing step.
%
% 'TimingSupport' = Support some hardware specific means of timestamping
% or latency measurements. On the Rift DK1 this does nothing. On the DK2
% it enables dynamic prediction and timing measurements with the Rifts internal
% latency tester.
%
% 'TimeWarp' = Enable per eye image 2D timewarping via prediction of eye
% poses at scanout time. This mostly only makes sense for head-tracked 3D
% rendering. Depending on 'basicQuality' a more cheap or more expensive
% procedure is used.
%
% 'basicQuality' defines the basic tradeoff between quality and required
% computational power. A setting of 0 gives lowest quality, but with the
% lowest performance requirements. A setting of 1 gives maximum quality at
% maximum computational load. Values between 0 and 1 change the quality to
% performance tradeoff.
%
%
% hmd = PsychOculusVR('Open' [, deviceIndex], ...);
% - Open HMD with index 'deviceIndex'. See PsychOculusVRCore Open?
% for help on additional parameters.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR('SetAutoClose', hmd, mode);
% - Set autoclose mode for HMD with handle 'hmd'. 'mode' can be
% 0 (this is the default) to not do anything special. 1 will close
% the HMD 'hmd' when the onscreen window is closed which displays
% on the HMD. 2 will do the same as 1, but close all open HMDs and
% shutdown the complete driver and Oculus runtime - a full cleanup.
%
%
% isOpen = PsychOculusVR('IsOpen', hmd);
% - Returns 1 if 'hmd' corresponds to an open HMD, 0 otherwise.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR('Close' [, hmd])
% - Close provided HMD device 'hmd'. If no 'hmd' handle is provided,
% all HMDs will be closed and the driver will be shutdown.
%
%
% info = PsychOculusVR('GetInfo', hmd);
% - Retrieve a struct 'info' with information about the HMD 'hmd'.
% The returned info struct contains at least the following standardized
% fields with information:
% handle = Driver internal handle for the specific HMD.
% driver = Function handle to the actual driver for the HMD, e.g., @PsychOculusVR.
% type   = Defines the type/vendor of the device, e.g., 'Oculus'.
% modelName = Name string with the name of the model of the device, e.g., 'Rift DK2'.
% separateEyePosesSupported = 1 if use of PsychOculusVR('GetEyePose') will improve
%                             the quality of the VR experience, 0 if no improvement
%                             is to be expected, so 'GetEyePose' can be avoided
%                             to save processing time without a loss of quality.
%                             This always returns 1 for at least the Rift DK1 and DK2,
%                             as use of that function can enhance the quality of the
%                             VR experience with fast head movements.
%
% The returned struct may contain more information, but the fields mentioned
% above are the only ones guaranteed to be available over the long run. Other
% fields may disappear or change their format and meaning anytime without
% warning.
%
%
% isSupported = PsychOculusVRCore('Supported');
% - Returns 1 if the Oculus driver is functional, 0 otherwise. The
% driver is functional if the VR runtime library was successfully
% initialized and a connection to the VR server process has been
% established. It would return 0 if the server process would not be
% running, or if the required runtime library would not be correctly
% installed.
%
%
% state = PsychOculusVRCore('PrepareRender', hmd [, userTransformMatrix][, reqmask=1][, targetTime]);
% - Mark the start of the rendering cycle for a new 3D rendered stereoframe.
% Return a struct 'state' which contains various useful bits of information
% for 3D stereoscopic rendering of a scene, based on head tracking data.
%
% 'hmd' is the handle of the HMD which delivers tracking data and receives the
% rendered content for display.
%
% 'reqmask' defines what kind of information is requested to be returned in
% struct 'state'. Only query information you actually need, as computing some
% of this info is expensive! See below for supported values for 'reqmask'.
%
% 'targetTime' is the expected time at which the rendered frame will display.
% This could potentially be used by the driver to make better predictions of
% camera/eye/head pose for the image. Omitting the value will use a target time
% that is implementation specific, but known to give generally good results,
% e.g., the midpoint of scanout of the next video frame.
%
% 'userTransformMatrix' is an optional 4x4 right hand side (RHS) transformation
% matrix. It gets applied to the tracked head pose as a global transformation
% before computing results based on head pose like, e.g., camera transformations.
% You can use this to translate the "virtual head" and thereby the virtual eyes/
% cameras in the 3D scene, so observer motion is not restricted to the real world
% tracking volume of your headset. A typical 'userTransformMatrix' would be a
% combined translation and rotation matrix to position the observer at some
% 3D location in space, then define his/her global looking direction, aka as
% heading angle, yaw orientation, or rotation around the y-axis in 3D space.
% Head pose tracking results would then operate relative to this global transform.
% If 'userTransformMatrix' is left out, it will default to an identity transform,
% in other words, it will do nothing.
%
%
% state always contains a field state.tracked, whose bits signal the status
% of head tracking for this frame. A +1 flag means that head orientation is
% tracked. A +2 flag means that head position is tracked via some absolute
% position tracker like, e.g., the Oculus Rift DK2 camera.
%
% 'reqmask' defaults to 1 and can have the following values added together:
%
% +1 = Return matrices for left and right "eye cameras" which can be directly
%      used as OpenGL GL_MODELVIEW matrices for rendering the scene. 4x4 matrices
%      for left- and right eye are contained in state.modelView{1} and {2}.
%
%      Return position and orientation 4x4 camera view matrices which describe
%      position and orientation of the "eye cameras" relative to the world
%      reference frame. They are the inverses of state.modelView{}. These
%      matrices can be directly used to define cameras for rendering of complex
%      3D scenes with the Horde3D 3D engine. Left- and right eye matrices are
%      contained in state.cameraView{1} and {2}.
%
%      Additionally tracked/predicted head pose is returned in state.localHeadPoseMatrix
%      and the global head pose after application of the 'userTransformMatrix' is
%      returned in state.globalHeadPoseMatrix - this is the basis for computing
%      the camera transformation matrices.
%
% More flags to follow...
%
%
% eyePose = PsychOculusVR('GetEyePose', hmd, renderPass [, userTransformMatrix][, targetTime]);
% - Return a struct 'eyePose' which contains various useful bits of information
% for 3D stereoscopic rendering of the stereo view of one eye, based on head
% tracking data. This function provides essentially the same information as
% the 'PrepareRender' function, but only for one eye. Therefore you will need
% to call this function twice, once for each of the two renderpasses, at the
% beginning of each renderpass.
%
% 'hmd' is the handle of the HMD which delivers tracking data and receives the
% rendered content for display.
%
% 'renderPass' defines if information should be returned for the 1st renderpass
% (renderPass == 0) or for the 2nd renderpass (renderPass == 1). The driver will
% decide for you if the 1st renderpass should render the left eye and the 2nd
% pass the right eye, or if the 1st renderpass should render the right eye and
% then the 2nd renderpass the left eye. The ordering depends on the properties
% of the video display of your HMD, specifically on the video scanout order:
% Is it right to left, left to right, or top to bottom? For each scanout order
% there is an optimal order for the renderpasses to minimize perceived lag.
%
% 'targetTime' is the expected time at which the rendered frame will display.
% This could potentially be used by the driver to make better predictions of
% camera/eye/head pose for the image. Omitting the value will use a target time
% that is implementation specific, but known to give generally good results.
%
% 'userTransformMatrix' is an optional 4x4 right hand side (RHS) transformation
% matrix. It gets applied to the tracked head pose as a global transformation
% before computing results based on head pose like, e.g., camera transformations.
% You can use this to translate the "virtual head" and thereby the virtual eyes/
% cameras in the 3D scene, so observer motion is not restricted to the real world
% tracking volume of your headset. A typical 'userTransformMatrix' would be a
% combined translation and rotation matrix to position the observer at some
% 3D location in space, then define his/her global looking direction, aka as
% heading angle, yaw orientation, or rotation around the y-axis in 3D space.
% Head pose tracking results would then operate relative to this global transform.
% If 'userTransformMatrix' is left out, it will default to an identity transform,
% in other words, it will do nothing.
%
% Return values in struct 'eyePose':
%
% 'eyeIndex' The eye for which this information applies. 0 = Left eye, 1 = Right eye.
%            You can pass 'eyeIndex' into the Screen('SelectStereoDrawBuffer', win, eyeIndex)
%            to select the proper eye target render buffer.
%
% 'modelView' is a 4x4 RHS OpenGL matrix which can be directly used as OpenGL
%             GL_MODELVIEW matrix for rendering the scene.
%
% 'cameraView' contains a 4x4 RHS camera matrix which describes position and
%              orientation of the "eye camera" relative to the world reference
%              frame. It is the inverse of eyePose.modelView. This matrix can
%              be directly used to define the camera for rendering of complex
%              3D scenes with the Horde3D 3D engine or other engines which want
%              absolute camera pose instead of the inverse matrix.
%
% Additionally tracked/predicted head pose is returned in eyePose.localHeadPoseMatrix
% and the global head pose after application of the 'userTransformMatrix' is
% returned in eyePose.globalHeadPoseMatrix - this is the basis for computing
% the camera transformation matrix.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR('SetupRenderingParameters', hmd [, basicTask='Tracked3DVR'][, basicRequirements][, basicQuality=0][, fov=[HMDRecommended]][, pixelsPerDisplay=1])
% - Query the HMD 'hmd' for its properties and setup internal rendering
% parameters in preparation for opening an onscreen window with PsychImaging
% to display properly on the HMD. See section about 'AutoSetupHMD' above for
% the meaning of the optional parameters 'basicTask', 'basicRequirements'
% and 'basicQuality'.
%
% 'fov' Optional field of view in degrees, from line of sight: [leftdeg, rightdeg,
% updeg, downdeg]. If 'fov' is omitted, the HMD runtime will be asked for a
% good default field of view and that will be used. The field of view may be
% dependent on the settings in the HMD user profile of the currently selected
% user.
%
% 'pixelsPerDisplay' Ratio of the number of render target pixels to display pixels
% at the center of distortion. Defaults to 1.0 if omitted. Lower values can
% improve performance, at lower quality.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR('SetBasicQuality', hmd, basicQuality);
% - Set basic level of quality vs. required GPU performance.
%
%
% oldSetting = PsychOculusVR('SetFastResponse', hmd [, enable]);
% - Return old setting for 'FastResponse' mode in 'oldSetting',
% optionally disable or enable the mode via specifying the 'enable'
% parameter as 0 or greater than zero. Please note that if you want to
% use 'FastResponse', you must request and thereby enable it at the
% beginning of a session, as the driver must do some neccessary setup
% prep work at startup of the HMD. Once it was initially enabled, you
% can switch the setting at runtime with this function.
%
% Currently implemented are an algorithmic overdrive mode if 'enable'
% is set to 1, and two lookup table (LUT) based modes for 'enable'
% settings of 2 or 3, each selecting a slightly different lookup table.
%
%
% oldSetting = PsychOculusVR('SetTimeWarp', hmd [, enable]);
% - Return old setting for 'TimeWarp' mode in 'oldSetting',
% optionally enable or disable the mode via specifying the 'enable'
% parameter as 1 or 0. Please note that if you want to use 'TimeWarp',
% you must request and thereby enable it at the beginning of a session, as
% the driver must do some neccessary setup prep work at startup of the HMD.
% Once it was initially enabled, you can switch the setting at runtime with
% this function.
%
%
% oldSetting = PsychOculusVR('SetLowPersistence', hmd [, enable]);
% - Return old setting for 'LowPersistence' mode in 'oldSetting',
% optionally enable or disable the mode via specifying the 'enable'
% parameter as 1 or 0.
%
%
% oldSettings = PsychOculusVR('PanelOverdriveParameters', hmd [, newparams]);
% - Return old settings for panel overdrive mode in 'oldSettings',
% optionally set new settings in 'newparams'. This changes the operating
% parameters of OLED panel overdrive on the Rift DK-2 if 'FastResponse'
% mode is active. newparams is a vector [upscale, downscale, gamma] with
% the following meaning: gamma = 1 Use gamma/degamma pass to perform
% overdrive boost in gamma 2.2 corrected space. This is the startup default.
% upscale = How much should rising pixel color intensity values be boosted.
% Default is 0.10 for a 10% boost.
% downscale = How much should rising pixel color intensity values be reduced.
% Default is 0.05 for a 5% reduction.
% The Rift DK-2 OLED panel controller is slower on rising intensities than on
% falling intensities, therefore the higher boost on rising than on falling
% direction.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR('SetHSWDisplayDismiss', hmd [, dismissTypes=1+2+4]);
% - Set how the user can dismiss the "Health and safety warning display".
% 'dismissTypes' can be -1 to disable the HSWD, or a value >= 0 to show
% the HSWD until a timeout and or until the user dismisses the HSWD.
% The following flags can be added to define type of dismissal:
%
% +0 = Display until timeout, if any. Will wait forever if there isn't any timeout!
% +1 = Dismiss via keyboard keypress.
% +2 = Dismiss via mouse click or mousepad tap.
% +4 = Dismiss via a tap to the HMD (detected via accelerometer).
%
%
% [bufferSize, imagingFlags, stereoMode] = PsychOculusVR('GetClientRenderingParameters', hmd);
% - Retrieve recommended size in pixels 'bufferSize' = [width, height] of the client
% renderbuffer for each eye for rendering to the HMD. Returns parameters
% previously computed by PsychOculusVR('SetupRenderingParameters', hmd).
%
% Also returns 'imagingFlags', the required imaging mode flags for setup of
% the Screen imaging pipeline. Also returns the needed 'stereoMode' for the
% pipeline.
%
%
% isOutput = PsychOculusVR('IsHMDOutput', hmd, scanout);
% - Returns 1 (true) if 'scanout' describes the video output to which the
% HMD 'hmd' is connected. 'scanout' is a struct returned by the Screen
% function Screen('ConfigureDisplay', 'Scanout', screenid, outputid);
% This allows probing video outputs to find the one which feeds the HMD.
%
%
% [headToEyeShiftv, headToEyeShiftMatrix] = PsychOculusVR('GetEyeShiftVector', hmd, eye);
% - Retrieve 3D translation vector [tx, ty, tz] that defines the 3D position of the given
% eye 'eye' for the given HMD 'hmd', relative to the origin of the local head/HMD
% reference frame. This is needed to translate a global head pose into a eye
% pose, e.g., to translate the output of PsychOculusVR('GetEyePose') into actual
% tracked/predicted eye locations for stereo rendering.
%
% In addition to the 'headToEyeShiftv' vector, a corresponding 4x4 translation
% matrix is also returned in 'headToEyeShiftMatrix' for convenience.

  % Caution: Must *copy* the different rows with data into *separate* variables, so
  % the vertex array pointers to the different variables actually point to something
  % persistent! If we'd pass the meshVerticesLeft() subarrays directly to glTexCoordPointer
  % and friends then Octave/Matlab would just create a temporary copy of the extracted
  % rows, OpenGL would retrieve/assign pointers to those temporary copies, but then
  % at the end of a glVertexPointer/glTexCoordPointer call, those temporary copies would
  % go out of scope and Octave/Matlab would potentially garbage collect the variables again
  % *before* the call to glDrawElements permanently records the content of the variables.
  % The net results would be stale/dangling pointers, random data trash getting read from
  % memory and recorded in the display list - and thereby corrupted rendering! This hazard
  % doesn't exist within regular Octave/Matlab scripts, because the interpreter doesn't
  % deal with memory pointers. It is a unique hazard from the combination of C memory
  % pointers for OpenGL and Octave/Matlabs copy-on-write/data-sharing/garbage collection
