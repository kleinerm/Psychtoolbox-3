% Our underlying PsychOpenXRCore mex driver builds against the Khronos OpenXR SDK public

%
% Note: If you want to write code that is portable across XR devices of
% different vendors, then use the PsychVRHMD() driver instead of this
% driver. The PsychVRHMD driver will use this driver as appropriate when
% connecting to a OpenXR supported XR device, but it will also
% automatically work with other head mounted displays. This driver does
% however expose a few functions specific to OpenXR hardware, so you can
% mix calls to this driver with calls to PsychVRHMD to do some mix & match.
%
% For setup instructions for OpenXR, see "help OpenXR".
%
%
% Usage:
%
% oldverbosity = PsychOpenXR('Verbosity' [, newverbosity]);
% - Get/Set level of verbosity for driver status messages, warning messages,
% error messages etc. 'newverbosity' is the optional new verbosity level,
% 'oldverbosity' is the currently set verbosity level - ie. before changing
% it.  Valid settings are: 0 = Silent, 1 = Errors only, 2 = Warnings, 3 = Info,
% 4 = Debug.
%
%
% hmd = PsychOpenXR('AutoSetupHMD' [, basicTask='Tracked3DVR'][, basicRequirements][, basicQuality=0][, deviceIndex]);
% - Open a OpenXR device, set it up with good default rendering and
% display parameters and generate a PsychImaging('AddTask', ...)
% line to setup the Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline for proper display
% on the device. This will also cause the device connection to get
% auto-closed as soon as the onscreen window which displays on
% the device is closed. Returns the 'hmd' handle of the device on success.
%
% By default, the first detected devide will be used and if no device
% is connected, it will return an empty [] hmd handle. You can override
% this default choice of device by specifying the optional 'deviceIndex'
% parameter to choose a specific device. However, only one device per machine is
% supported, so the 'deviceIndex' will probably be only useful in the future.
%
% More optional parameters: 'basicTask' what kind of task should be implemented.
% The default is 'Tracked3DVR', which means to setup for stereoscopic 3D
% rendering, driven by head motion tracking, for a fully immersive experience
% in some kind of 3D virtual world. This is the default if omitted. The task
% 'Stereoscopic' sets up for display of stereoscopic stimuli, but without
% head tracking. 'Monoscopic' sets up for display of monocular stimuli, ie.
% the device is just used as a special kind of standard display monitor. In 'Monoscopic'
% and 'Stereoscopic' mode, both eyes will be presented with an identical field of view,
% to make sure pure 2D drawing works, without the need for setup of special per-eye
% projection transformations. In 'Tracked3DVR' mode, each eye will have a different
% field of view, optimized to maximize the viewable area while still avoiding occlusion
% artifacts due to the nose of the wearer of the device.
%
% In monoscopic or stereoscopic mode, you can change the imaging parameters, ie.,
% apparent size and location of the 2D views used with the following command to
% optimize visual display:
%
% [oldPosition, oldSize, oldOrientation] = PsychOpenXR('View2DParameters', hmd, eye [, position][, size][, orientation]);
%
%
% 'basicRequirements' defines basic requirements for the task. Currently
% defined are the following strings which can be combined into a single
% 'basicRequirements' string:
%
% 'ForceSize=widthxheight' = Enforce a specific fixed size of the stimulus
% image buffer in pixels, overriding the recommmended value by the runtime,
% e.g., 'ForceSize=2200x1200' for a 2200 pixels wide and 1200 pixels high
% image buffer. By default the driver will choose values that provide good
% quality for the given XR display device, which can be scaled up or down
% with the optional 'pixelsPerDisplay' parameter for a different quality vs.
% performance tradeoff in the function PsychOpenXR('SetupRenderingParameters');
% The specified values are clamped against the maximum values supported by
% the given hardware + driver combination.
%
% 'Float16Display' = Request rendering, compositing and display in 16 bpc float
% format. This will ask Psychtoolbox to render and post-process stimuli in 16 bpc
% linear floating point format, and allocate 16 bpc half-float textures as final
% renderbuffers to be sent to the VR compositor. If the VR compositor takes advantage
% of the high source image precision is at the discretion of the compositor and device.
% By default, if this request is omitted, processing and display in sRGB format is
% requested from Psychtoolbox and the compositor, ie., a roughly gamma 2.2 8 bpc
% format is used.
%
% 'ForbidMultiThreading' = Forbid any use of multi-threading for visual
% presentation by the driver for any means or purposes! This is meant to
% get your setup going in case of severe bugs in proprietary OpenXR
% runtimes that can cause instability, hangs, crashes or other malfunctions
% when multi-threading is used. Or if one wants to squeeze out every last
% bit of performance, no matter the consequences ("Fast and furious mode").
% On many proprietary OpenXR runtimes, this will prevent any reliable,
% trustworthy, robust or accurate presentation timing or timestamping, and
% may cause severe visual glitches under some modes of operation. See the
% following keywords below for descriptions of various more nuanced
% approaches to multi-threading vs. single-threading to choose fine-tuned
% tradeoffs between performance, stability and correctness for your
% specific experimental needs.
%
% 'Use2DViewsWhen3DStopped' = Ask the driver to switch to use of the same 2D views
% and geometry during the '3DVR' or 'Tracked3DVR' basicTask as would be used
% for pure 2D display in basicTask 'Stereoscopic' whenever the user script
% signals it does not execute a tight tracking and animation loop, ie.
% whenever the script calls PsychVRHMD('Stop', hmd). Switch back to regular
% 3D projected geometry and views after a consecutive PsychVRHMD('Start', hmd).
% This is useful if have phases in your experiment session when you want to
% display non-tracked content, e.g., instructions or feedback to the
% subject between trials, fixation crosses, etc., or pause script execution
% for more than a few milliseconds, but still want the visual display to
% stay stable. If this keyword is omitted, depending on the specific OpenXR
% runtime in use, the driver will stabilize the regular 3D projected
% display by use of multi-threaded operation when calling PsychVRHMD('Stop', hmd),
% and resume single-threaded operation after PsychVRHMD('Start', hmd). This
% higher overhead mode of operation via multi-threading will possibly have
% degraded performance, and not only between the 'Stop' and 'Start' calls,
% but throughout the whole session! This is why it can be advisable to
% evaulate if use of the 'Use2DViewsWhen3DStopped' keyword is a better
% solution for your specific experiment paradigm. The switching between 3D
% projected view and standard 2D stereoscopic view will change the image
% though, which may disorient the subject for a moment while the subjects
% eyes need to adapt their accomodation, vergence and focus point. You can
% change the imaging parameters, ie., apparent size and location of the 2D
% views used in this mode with the following command to minimize visual
% disorientation:
%
% [oldPosition, oldSize, oldOrientation] = PsychOpenXR('View2DParameters', hmd, eye [, position][, size][, orientation]);
%
% For such 2D views you can also specify the distance of the virtual
% viewscreen in meters in front of the eyes of the subject. By default the
% distance is 1 meter and the size and position is set up to fill out the
% field of view in a meaningful way, essentially covering the whole
% available field of view. By overriding the distance to a smaller or
% bigger distance than 1 meter, you can "zoom in" to the image, or make
% sure that also the corners and edges of the image are visible. E.g., the
% following keyword would place the virtual screen at 2.1 meters distance:
%
% '2DViewDistMeters=2.1'
%
% 'DontCareAboutVisualGlitchesWhenStopped' = Tell the driver that you don't
% care about potential significant visual presentation glitches happening if
% your script does not run a continuous animation with high framerate, e.g.,
% after calling PsychVRHMD('Stop', hmd), pausing, etc. This makes sense if
% you don't care, or if your script does not ever pause or slow down during
% a session or at least an ongoing trial. This will avoid multi-threading
% for glitch prevention in such cases, possibly allowing to side-step
% certain bugs in proprietary OpenXR runtimes, or to squeeze out higher
% steady-state performance.
%
% 'NoTimingSupport' = Signal no need at all for high precision and reliability
% timing for presentation. If you don't need any timing precision or
% reliability in your script, specifying this keyword may allow the driver
% to optimize for higher performance. See 'TimingSupport' explanation right
% below:
%
% 'TimingSupport' = Use high precision and reliability timing for presentation.
%
% The current OpenXR specification, as of OpenXR version v1.0.26 from January 2023,
% does not provide any means of reliable, trustworthy, accurate timestamping of
% presentation, and all so far tested proprietary OpenXR runtime implementations
% have severely broken and defective timing support. Only the open-source
% Monado OpenXR runtime on Linux provides a reliable and accurate timing
% implementation. Therefore this driver has to use a workaround on non-Monado
% OpenXR runtimes to achieve at least ok'ish timing if you require it, and
% that workaround involves multi-threaded operation. This multi-threading
% in turn can severely degrade performance, possibly reducing achievable
% presentation framerates to (less than) half of the maximum video refresh
% rate of your device! For this reason you should only request 'TimingSupport'
% on non-Monado if you really need it and be willing to pay the performance
% price.
%
% If you omit this keyword, the driver will try to guess if you need
% precise presentation timing for your session or not. As long as you only
% call Screen('Flip', window) or Screen('Flip', window, [], ...), ie. don't
% specify a requested stimulus onset time, the driver assumes you don't
% need precise timing, just presenting as soon as possible after a
% Screen('Flip'), and also that you don't care about accurate or trustworthy
% or correct presentation timestamps to be returned by Screen('Flip'). Once
% you specify a target onset time tWhen, ie. via calling 'Flip' as
% Screen('Flip', window, tWhen [, ...]), the driver assumes from then on
% and for the rest of the session that you want reasonably accurate
% presentation timing. It will then switch to multi-threaded operation with
% better timing, but potentially drastically reduced performance.
%
% 'TimestampingSupport' = Use high precision and reliability timestamping for presentation.
%
% 'NoTimestampingSupport' = Do not need high precision and reliability timestamping for presentation.
% Those keywords let you specify if you definitely need or don't need
% trustworthy, reliable, robust, precise presentation timestamps, ie. the
% 'timestamp' return values of timestamp = Screen('Flip') should be high
% quality, or if you don't care. If you omit both keywords, the driver will
% try to guess what you wanted. On most current OpenXR runtimes, use of
% timestamping will imply multi-threaded operation with the performance
% impacts and problems mentioned above in the section about 'TimingSupport',
% that is why it is advisable to explicitely state your needs, to allow the
% driver to optimize for the best precision/reliability/performance
% tradeoff on all the runtimes where such a tradeoff is required.
%
% As mentioned here, in "help PsychVRHMD" and our "help OpenXR" overview
% and setup instructions, currently no standard OpenXR implementation with
% reliable and trustworthy timestamping exists. Proper enhancements to
% OpenXR will need to be done in the future. Right now, as of Psychtoolbox
% 3.0.19.2, we have a hacky solution for a subset of Linux users, called
% "Monado metrics timestamping hack". It goes as follows:
%
% If you need reliable timestamping, the only solution right now is to use
% Linux + the latest Monado upstream version + a modified version of Mesa + an
% AMD or Intel gpu of sufficient performance + a VR HMD supported by Monado
% on Linux. Contact our paid support "help PsychPaidSupportAndServices" for
% help in setting up this feature and getting suitable modified Monado and
% Mesa drivers. Once everything is installed on the hardware and software
% side, the following steps need to be taken at the start of each
% experiment session to enable the special Monado metrics timestamping hack
% for trustworthy timestamping at the price of lowered performance:
%
%     1. Create a Linux fifo pipe file, e.g., in a terminal type
%        "sudo mkfifo /usr/local/framequeue.protobuf"
%        You can choose any file path and name instead of
%        /usr/local/framequeue.protobuf but it makes sense to choose a
%        directory which is under your users control, not a temporary
%        directory, unless you want to repeat step 1 after each system
%        reboot. In steps 2 and 3 you must path the same path/filename to
%        both monado-service and Octave/Matlab via the XRT_METRICS_FILE
%        environment variable.
%
%     2. Start monado-service and use the created fifo file as output file
%        for the metrics log, e.g., in a terminal window via
%
%        "XRT_METRICS_FILE=/usr/local/framequeue.protobuf XRT_METRICS_EARLY_FLUSH=true monado-service"
%
%        This will launch the monado-service OpenXR compositor, enable its
%        metrics logging with low latency into the fifo, and block its
%        startup until the Psychtoolbox XR work session is started.
%
%     3. Start a PTB session, also with XRT_METRICS_FILE environment variable
%        specified to the same fifo file location during launch of Octave or
%        Matlab, e.g., in a terminal start Octave or Matlab via:
%
%        "XRT_METRICS_FILE=/usr/local/framequeue.protobuf octave --gui" or
%        "XRT_METRICS_FILE=/usr/local/framequeue.protobuf matlab"
%
%        Once the PsychOpenXR driver has detected that a Monado XR server is
%        running, and that the fifo file exists and is accessible, it opens
%        that fifo for read access, which will let monado-service fully start
%        up and get ready to serve OpenXR clients. Your Psychtoolbox session
%        should then work with trustworthy timestamps, but at potentially
%        significantly reduced performance, e.g., a framerate of only half
%        or a third of the refresh rate of your VR HMD display.
%
%
% 'Eyetracking' = Request eye gaze tracking via a supported HMD builtin eye tracker.
% This keyword asks the driver to enable eye gaze tracking. A given combo
% of VR/AR/MR device (and its builtin eye tracker), operating system, OpenXR
% runtime and additional optionally installed eye tracking software, may
% support multiple different gaze tracking api's and runtimes. By default,
% the driver will try to use the most capable gaze tracking api, ie. the
% one which provides the most detailed and exhaustive information about the
% users gaze, at the highest sampling rate, with the most flexibility. It
% will fall back to less capable or efficient tracking api's if more
% capable ones are not supported or available. For this reason, the amount
% of information can differ widely between the most capable api's and the
% most basic api's. User scripts which strive to be usable on different
% operating systems, software setups or eyetracking hardware and HMDs must
% therefore be written in a defensive and adaptive way to be able to work
% with only the minimal subset of information guaranteed to be available on
% all implementations. The info struct returned by info = PsychVRHMD('GetInfo');
% contains info about basic gaze tracking capabilities as a bitmask in
% info.eyeTrackingSupported: A value of +1 means at least one gaze vector
% is reported. A value of +2 means reporting of binocular eye tracking data
% is supported. A value of +1024 means that HTC's proprietary SRAnipal
% eyetracking is used for more extensive gaze data reporting.
%
% If eye tracking is requested via the keyword and supported, then the user
% script can request return of the most recent eye gaze tracking sample
% data by calling the state = PsychVRHMD('PrepareRender', ..., reqmask, ...)
% function with reqmask flag +4. This will cause the returned 'state' struct
% to contain additional fields with information about the most recent gaze.
% See help text for the 'PrepareRender' function for more detailed info.
%
% The current driver supports the following gazetracking implementations:
%
% - With HTC VR HMDs with eyetracking support, under Microsoft Windows, in
% combination with the optional HTC SRAnipal runtime DLL's installed, and
% using Matlab, an optional SRAnipal mex driver can be used to provide both
% binocular per-eye gaze tracking data, separate for the subjects left and
% right eye, and a virtual 3rd "cyclops eye" which is synthesized info from
% both hardware eye trackers, sometimes of higher quality due to sensor
% fusion of the two gaze tracker data streams. For each of both eyes, in
% addition to eye gaze position and direction, estimated pupil size in
% millimeters and a measure of eye openess is reported, e.g., for eye
% blink detection or estimation of gaze data reliability. Reported times
% are hardware timestamps of when a gaze sample was measured. On the tested
% "HTC Vive Pro Eye" HMD sampling rates of up to 120 Hz were possible.
%
% - On other device + operating system + OpenXR runtime combos with OpenXR
% gazetracking support, information from the XR_EXT_eye_gaze_interaction
% gaze tracking extension is returned. This extension is supported on a wider
% range of XR devices, but the returned information is more limited: A
% single eye gaze vector and position, but without any information about the
% subjects eye openess, pupil size or of the systems confidence in the quality
% of the measured gaze. The gaze vector is of unspecified origin. It could
% be measured gaze from a monocular eye tracker, ie. either left or right eye
% gaze, or it could be a "cyclops eye" synthesized gaze computed via sensor
% fusion of gaze data from a binocular gaze tracker. The gaze data may be
% measured data from a time in the past, or interpolated or extrapolated
% gaze data from one or more past measured eye gaze samples. The returned
% gaze sample timestamp may be a hardware timestamp of when the gaze sample
% was measured, but could also be the time for which gaze was predicted via
% interpolation or extrapolation of past hardware measured gaze samples.
% Temporal resolution of the gaze data is also unspecified. On the tested
% HTC Vive Pro Eye, the reported gaze seems to correspond to the sensor
% fusion of gaze samples from the binocular eye tracker, and the temporal
% resolution is reduced to at best 16.6 msecs for at most 60 gaze samples
% per second.
%
% 'basicQuality' defines the basic tradeoff between quality and required
% computational power. A setting of 0 gives lowest quality, but with the
% lowest performance requirements. A setting of 1 gives maximum quality at
% maximum computational load. Values between 0 and 1 change the quality to
% performance tradeoff.
%
%
% hmd = PsychOpenXR('Open' [, deviceIndex], ...);
% - Open device with index 'deviceIndex'. See PsychOpenXRCore Open?
% for help on additional parameters.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('SetAutoClose', hmd, mode);
% - Set autoclose mode for device with handle 'hmd'. 'mode' can be
% 0 (this is the default) to not do anything special. 1 will close
% the device 'hmd' when the onscreen window is closed which displays
% on the device. 2 will do the same as 1, but close all open HMDs and
% shutdown the complete driver and OpenXR runtime - a full cleanup.
%
%
% isOpen = PsychOpenXR('IsOpen', hmd);
% - Returns 1 if 'hmd' corresponds to an open device, 0 otherwise.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('Close' [, hmd]);
% - Close provided device 'hmd'. If no 'hmd' handle is provided,
% all HMDs will be closed and the driver will be shutdown.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('Controllers', hmd);
% - Return a bitmask of all connected controllers: Can be the bitand
% of the OVR.ControllerType_XXX flags described in 'GetInputState'.
%
%
% info = PsychOpenXR('GetInfo', hmd);
% - Retrieve a struct 'info' with information about the device 'hmd'.
% The returned info struct contains at least the following standardized
% fields with information:
%
% handle = Driver internal handle for the specific device.
% driver = Function handle to the actual driver for the device, e.g., @PsychOpenXR.
% type   = Defines the type/vendor of the device, e.g., 'OpenXR'.
% modelName = Name string with the name of the model of the device, e.g., 'Rift DK2'.
% separateEyePosesSupported = 1 if use of PsychOpenXR('GetEyePose') will improve
%                             the quality of the VR experience, 0 if no improvement
%                             is to be expected, so 'GetEyePose' can be avoided
%                             to save processing time without a loss of quality.
%                             This *always* returns 0 on this PsychOpenXR driver.
%
% eyeTrackingSupported = Info about eye gaze tracking capabilities. A value
% of +1 means at least one gaze vector is reported. A value of +2 means
% reporting of binocular per-eye tracking data is supported. A value of
% +1024 means that HTC's proprietary SRAnipal eyetracking is available for
% more extensive gaze data reporting.
%
% The returned struct may contain more information, but the fields mentioned
% above are the only ones guaranteed to be available over the long run. Other
% fields may disappear or change their format and meaning anytime without
% warning. See 'help PsychVRHMD' for more detailed info about available fields.
%
%
% isSupported = PsychOpenXR('Supported');
% - Returns 1 if the OpenXR driver is functional, 0 otherwise. The
% driver is functional if the VR runtime library was successfully
% initialized and a connection to the VR server process has been
% established. It would return 0 if the server process would not be
% running, or if the required runtime library would not be correctly
% installed.
%
%
% [isVisible, playAreaBounds, OuterAreaBounds] = PsychOpenXR('VRAreaBoundary', hmd [, requestVisible]);
% - Request visualization of the VR play area boundary for 'hmd' and returns its
% current extents.
%
% 'requestVisible' 1 = Request showing the boundary area markers, 0 = Don't
% request showing the markers. This parameter is accepted, but ignored for OpenXR.
%
% Returns in 'isVisible' the current visibility status of the VR area boundaries.
% This driver always returns 0 for false / invisible.
%
% 'playAreaBounds' is a 3-by-n matrix defining the play area boundaries. Each
% column represents the [x;y;z] coordinates of one 3D definition point. Connecting
% successive points by line segments defines the boundary, as projected onto the
% floor. Points are listed in clock-wise direction. An empty return argument means
% that the play area is so far undefined. This driver returns empty if the boundaries
% are unknown. Otherwise it returns the bounding rectangle of the area, as current
% unextended OpenXR runtimes can only return a rectangle, not more complex boundaries.
%
% 'OuterAreaBounds' defines the outer area boundaries in the same way as
% 'playAreaBounds'. This driver currently returns the same as 'playAreaBounds', as
% current unextended OpenXR only supports that information.
%
%
% input = PsychOpenXR('GetInputState', hmd, controllerType);
% - Get input state of controller 'controllerType' associated with device 'hmd'.
%
% 'controllerType' can be one of OVR.ControllerType_LTouch, OVR.ControllerType_RTouch,
% OVR.ControllerType_Touch, OVR.ControllerType_Remote, OVR.ControllerType_XBox, or
% OVR.ControllerType_Active for selecting whatever controller is currently active.
%
% Return argument 'input' is a struct with fields describing the state of buttons and
% other input elements of the specified 'controllerType'. It has the following fields:
%
% 'Valid' = 1 if 'input' contains valid results, 0 if input status is invalid/unavailable.
% 'Time' Time of last input state change of controller.
% 'ActiveInputs' = Bitmask defining which of the following struct elements do contain
% meaningful input from actual physical input source devices. This is a more fine-grained
% reporting of what 'Valid' conveys, split up into categories. The following flags will be
% logical or'ed together if the corresponding input category is valid, ie. provided with
% actual input data from some physical input source element, controller etc.:
%
% +1  = 'Buttons' gets input from some real buttons or switches.
% +2  = 'Touches' gets input from some real touch/proximity sensors or gesture recognizers.
% +4  = 'Trigger' gets input from some real analog trigger sensor or gesture recognizer.
% +8  = 'Grip' gets input from some real analog grip sensor or gesture recognizer.
% +16 = 'Thumbstick' gets input from some real thumbstick, joystick or trackpad or similar 2D sensor.
% +32 = 'Thumbstick2' gets input from some real secondary thumbstick, joystick or trackpad or similar 2D sensor.
%
% 'Buttons' Vector with button state on the controller, similar to the 'keyCode'
% vector returned by KbCheck() for regular keyboards. Each position in the vector
% reports pressed (1) or released (0) state of a specific button. Use the OVR.Button_XXX
% constants to map buttons to positions.
%
% 'Touches' Like 'Buttons' but for touch buttons. Use the OVR.Touch_XXX constants to map
% touch points to positions.
%
% 'Trigger'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) trigger: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, filtered and with dead-zone.
% 'TriggerNoDeadzone'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) trigger: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, filtered.
% 'TriggerRaw'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) trigger: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, raw values unfiltered.
% 'Grip'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) grip button: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, filtered and with dead-zone.
% 'GripNoDeadzone'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) grip button: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, filtered.
% 'GripRaw'(1/2) = Left (1) and Right (2) grip button: Value range 0.0 - 1.0, raw values unfiltered.
%
% 'Thumbstick' = 2x2 matrix: Column 1 contains left thumbsticks [x;y] axis values, column 2 contains
%  right sticks [x;y] axis values. Values are in range -1 to +1, filtered and with deadzone applied.
% 'ThumbstickNoDeadzone' = Like 'Thumbstick', filtered, but without a deadzone applied.
% 'ThumbstickRaw' = 'Thumbstick' raw date without deadzone or filtering applied.
%
% 'Thumbstick2' = Like 'Thumbstick', but for devices with a 2nd 2D input device for each hand, e.g.,
% a 2nd thumbstick or a trackpad.
%
%
% pulseEndTime = PsychOpenXR('HapticPulse', hmd, controllerType [, duration=2.5][, freq=1.0][, amplitude=1.0]);
% - Trigger a haptic feedback pulse, some controller vibration, on the
% specified 'controllerType' associated with the specified 'hmd'.
%
% Currently supported values for 'controllerType' are:
%
% OVR.ControllerType_XBox   - The Microsoft XBox controller or compatible gamepad.
% OVR.ControllerType_Remote - Connected remote control or similar, e.g., control buttons on device.
% OVR.ControllerType_LTouch - Haptic enabled left hand controller.
% OVR.ControllerType_RTouch - Haptic enabled right hand controller.
% OVR.ControllerType_Touch  - All haptics enabled hand controllers.
% OVR.ControllerType_Active - All active haptics enabled controllers.
%
% 'duration' is requested pulse duration in seconds. By default a pulse of
% 2.5 seconds duration is executed, as this is the maximum pulse duration
% supported by Oculus Rift CV1 touch controllers. Other controllers or
% OpenXR runtimes may have different limits on pulse duration, or no limit
% at all. A duration of 0 maps to the minimum duration supported by the
% active OpenXR runtime and device. 'freq' may be a normalized frequency in
% range 0.0 - 1.0, or a higher frequency in Hz. A value of 0 will disable
% an ongoing pulse. The range up to 1.0 gets mapped to the interval 0 - 320
% Hz for backwards compatibility with older Oculus VR drivers. Values
% greater than 1 are interpreted as desired frequency in Hz. OpenXR
% runtimes and hardware may clamp the requested frequency to implementation
% dependent minimum or maximum values, or quantize to only a few discrete
% frequencies. E.g., Oculus touch controllers only support 160 Hz and 320
% Hz, no other frequencies. 'amplitude' is the amplitude of the vibration
% in normalized 0.0 - 1.0 range.
%
% 'pulseEndTime' returns the expected stop time of vibration in seconds,
% given the parameters. This may be inaccurate, depending on OpenXR runtime
% and hardware.
%
% In general, unfortunately, testing so far shows that OpenXR runtimes vary
% considerably in how well they follow the requested haptic pulse duration,
% frequency, and timing, so some caution is advised wrt. haptic pulse
% feedback. Never trust a given software + hardware combo blindly, always
% verify your specific setup!

% state = PsychOpenXR('PrepareRender', hmd [, userTransformMatrix][, reqmask=1][, targetTime]);
% - Mark the start of the rendering cycle for a new 3D rendered stereoframe.
% Return a struct 'state' which contains various useful bits of information
% for 3D stereoscopic rendering of a scene, based on head tracking data.
%
% 'hmd' is the handle of the device which delivers tracking data and receives the
% rendered content for display.
%
% 'reqmask' defines what kind of information is requested to be returned in
% struct 'state'. Only query information you actually need, as computing some
% of this info is expensive! See below for supported values for 'reqmask'.
%
% 'targetTime' is the expected time at which the rendered frame will display.
% This could potentially be used by the driver to make better predictions of
% camera/eye/head pose for the image. Omitting the value will use a target time
% that is implementation specific, but known to give generally good results,
% e.g., the midpoint of scanout of the next video frame.
%
% 'userTransformMatrix' is an optional 4x4 right hand side (RHS) transformation
% matrix. It gets applied to the tracked head pose as a global transformation
% before computing results based on head pose like, e.g., camera transformations.
% You can use this to translate the "virtual head" and thereby the virtual eyes/
% cameras in the 3D scene, so observer motion is not restricted to the real world
% tracking volume of your headset. A typical 'userTransformMatrix' would be a
% combined translation and rotation matrix to position the observer at some
% 3D location in space, then define his/her global looking direction, aka as
% heading angle, yaw orientation, or rotation around the y-axis in 3D space.
% Head pose tracking results would then operate relative to this global transform.
% If 'userTransformMatrix' is left out, it will default to an identity transform,
% in other words, it will do nothing.
%
%
% state always contains a field state.tracked, whose bits signal the status
% of head tracking for this frame. A +1 flag means that head orientation is
% tracked. A +2 flag means that head position is tracked via some absolute
% position tracker like, e.g., the Oculus Rift DK2 or Rift CV1 camera. A +128
% flag means the device is actually strapped onto the subjects head and displaying
% our visual content. Lack of this flag means the device is off and thereby blanked
% and dark, or we lost access to it to another application.
%
% state also always contains a field state.SessionState, whose bits signal general
% VR session status:
% +1  = Our rendering goes to the device, ie. we have control over it. Lack of this could
%       mean the Health and Safety warning is displaying at the moment and waiting for
%       acknowledgement, or the OpenXR GUI application is in control.
% +2  = Device is present and active.
% +4  = Device is strapped onto users head. A Rift CV1 would switch off/blank if not on the head.
% +8  = DisplayLost condition! Some hardware/software malfunction, need to completely quit this
%       Psychtoolbox session to recover from this.
% +16 = ShouldQuit The user interface / user asks us to voluntarily terminate this session.
% +32 = ShouldRecenter = The user interface asks us to recenter/recalibrate our tracking origin.
%
% 'reqmask' defaults to 1 and can have the following values added together:
%
% +1 = Return matrices for left and right "eye cameras" which can be directly
%      used as OpenGL GL_MODELVIEW matrices for rendering the scene. 4x4 matrices
%      for left- and right eye are contained in state.modelView{1} and {2}.
%
%      Return position and orientation 4x4 camera view matrices which describe
%      position and orientation of the "eye cameras" relative to the world
%      reference frame. They are the inverses of state.modelView{}. These
%      matrices can be directly used to define cameras for rendering of complex
%      3D scenes with the Horde3D 3D engine. Left- and right eye matrices are
%      contained in state.cameraView{1} and {2}.
%
%      Additionally tracked/predicted head pose is returned in state.localHeadPoseMatrix
%      and the global head pose after application of the 'userTransformMatrix' is
%      returned in state.globalHeadPoseMatrix - this is the basis for computing
%      the camera transformation matrices.
%
% +2 = Return matrices for tracked left and right hands of user, ie. of tracked positions
%      and orientations of left and right XR input controllers, if any.
%
%      state.handStatus(1) = Tracking status of left hand: 0 = Untracked, 1 = Orientation
%                            tracked, 2 = Position tracked, 3 = Orientation and position
%                            tracked. If handStatus is == 0 then all the following information
%                            is invalid and can not be used in any meaningful way.
%      state.handStatus(2) = Tracking status of right hand.
%
%      state.localHandPoseMatrix{1} = 4x4 OpenGL right handed reference frame matrix with
%                                     hand position and orientation encoded to define a
%                                     proper GL_MODELVIEW transform for rendering stuff
%                                     "into"/"relative to" the oriented left hand.
%      state.localHandPoseMatrix{2} = Ditto for the right hand.
%
%      state.globalHandPoseMatrix{1} = userTransformMatrix * state.localHandPoseMatrix{1};
%                                      Left hand pose transformed by passed in userTransformMatrix.
%      state.globalHandPoseMatrix{2} = Ditto for the right hand.
%
%      state.globalHandPoseInverseMatrix{1} = Inverse of globalHandPoseMatrix{1} for collision
%                                             testing/grasping of virtual objects relative to
%                                             hand pose of left hand.
%      state.globalHandPoseInverseMatrix{2} = Ditto for right hand.
%
% +4 = Return the most recent eye gaze information on devices with built-in eye tracking hardware.
%      Returned information may represent the latest available measured eye
%      gaze data, or it may be predicted eye gaze information for the
%      specified 'targetTime', computed via interpolation or extrapolation
%      from actual previously measured eye gaze. This is dependent on the
%      specific gaze tracker implementation of your system. If the reported
%      gaze sample timestamps are identical to the provided 'targetTime'
%      then that is one possible indication that reported gaze may be
%      predicted gaze instead of a direct hardware measured gaze sample.
%
%      The following fields are mandatory as part of the state struct, if gaze
%      tracking is supported and enabled and requested:
%
%      state.gazeRaw = If no new gaze tracking data is available, returns an
%      empty [] variable. Otherwise a variable in a format that is
%      dependent on the actually used gaze tracking api and implementation.
%      It could be a vector, a struct, an array of structs... The format
%      may change without prior notice, without any regard for backward
%      compatibility, so it is mostly useful for debugging by the PTB
%      developers or other Psychtoolbox internal special use cases, not to
%      be relied on by regular user experiment scripts!
%
%      The following variables are arrays, whose length depends on the
%      used gaze tracking method. Each array element represents properties
%      of one tracked eye gaze. At a minimum, the arrays have one element
%      for the most basic gaze tracking, e.g., if the OpenXR extension
%      XR_EXT_eye_gaze_interaction is used for gaze tracking, it will only
%      report one gaze vector in index 1: A monocular gaze sample from either
%      the left or right eye, or a synthetic "cyclops eye" gaze sample, computed
%      via sensor fusion of data from a binocular gazetracker. The arrays could
%      also have 2 elements for a purely binocular eye tracker, with index 1 for
%      the left eye, and index 2 for the right eye data. On a binocular tracker,
%      it is also possible for a three element array to be returned, in
%      which case index 1 is left eye date, 2 is right eye date, and 3 is
%      synthesized "cyclops eye" data.
% 
%      Please write your scripts so they can handle any number of 1, 2 or
%      three array elements meaningfully:
%
%      state.gazeStatus(i) = A flag telling if i'th gaze is unavailable
%                            (=0), available (+1) or available and somewhat
%                            trustworthy (+2). Values other than 3 (=1+2)
%                            should not really be trusted. A value of only
%                            1 could, e.g., mean that data was reported,
%                            but it is not based on an actual measured eye
%                            gaze sample, but purely extrapolated or
%                            predicted from past valid data. A value of 3
%                            is not a guarantee of high quality data, just
%                            that the data is actually measured eye gaze
%                            data and passed the minimum quality treshold.
%
%
%      state.gazeTime(i) = A timestamps of the time for which the given
%      gaze information is valid. Depending on gaze tracking method in use,
%      this could be a time in the past, referring to the hardware
%      timestamp of when the gaze tracker hardware acquired that sample, or
%      it could be the time in the past or near future for which the gaze
%      data was computed via prediction / extrapolation of gaze movement or
%      interpolation from past gaze tracking data history. OpenXR built in
%      gaze tracking extensions often may not report the most recent
%      measured eye gaze sample from a past tracking cycle. Instead they
%      take the user provided 'targetTime' (or predicted stimulus onset
%      time for the next to-be-presented VR/AR/MR/XR stimulus image, if
%      'targetTime' was omitted) and try to predict where the subject will
%      be looking (for a 'targetTime' in the near future) or has looked
%      (for a 'targetTime' in the near past). In case of such prediction,
%      the reported state.gazeTime(i) corresponds to the time for which
%      gaze was actually predicted. It is a bit of a hazard for scientific
%      research purposes that there is some uncertainty if timestamps refer
%      to time of real measured gaze, or to some predicted time, or that
%      prediction / interpolation / extrapolation may be used instead of
%      reporting measured data, or that the prediction method - if any - is
%      not specified or standardized across different devices, gaze
%      trackers and gaze tracking runtimes and api's. This is unfortunately
%      unavoidable, as most commercial off the shelf gaze trackers for XR
%      applications are not targeted at scientific research use cases, but
%      as human computer interaction method for operating and navigating in
%      VR and AR, e.g., for gaming and entertainment purposes. Not much we
%      could do about this, so you will have to deal with this in your
%      research paradigm or carefully select hardware with known suitable
%      properties for your specific use case.
%
%      Actual gaze information is provided in two formats, a 2D format, in
%      onscreen window pixel coordinates, ie. where in the image has the
%      subject looked, and a 3D format, as 3D gaze rays, ie. where in a
%      rendered 3D scene has the subject looked:
%
%      2D - Onscreen window referenced:
%
%      state.gazePos{i} = A two-element [x,y] vector of the estimated 2D user
%      gaze position in Psychtoolbox onscreen window coordinates. Iow. the
%      x,y coordinates of where the user looked. In mono display mode this
%      is done by mapping the users gaze vector to the 2D space of the
%      common image that is displayed in the left and right eye display of
%      a VR/AR/MR HMD. In stereoscopic 2D display mode or full 3D perspective
%      correct rendering mode with potential head tracking, where a different
%      image is rendered and displayed to the subjects left and right eye, the
%      mapping of indices is as follows: state.gazePos{1} is expressed wrt.
%      to the left eye image buffer, ie. the one selected via
%      Screen('SelectStereoDrawBuffer', win, 0);. state.gazePos{2} refers
%      to the right eye image buffer (Screen('SelectStereoDrawBuffer', win, 0);).
%      state.gazePos{3} for a potential synthetic "cyclops eye" gaze will
%      reference the left eye image buffer again.
%
%      3D - 3D scene geometry referenced:
%
%      state.gazeRayLocal{i} = encodes the subjects gaze direction / line
%      of sight within a HMD fixed reference frame:
%
%      state.gazeRayLocal{i}.gazeC = a [x,y,z] 3D vector denoting the
%      estimated position of the optical center of the subjects eye balls,
%      relative to the origin of the head-fixed reference frame.
%
%      state.gazeRayLocal{i}.gazeD = a [dx,dy,dz] 3D vector denoting the
%      gaze direction in the head-fixed x, y and z axis.
%
%      The values in gazeRayLocal therefore define a 3D line equation
%      denoting the users line of sight, a "gaze ray" so to speak:
%
%      For all scalar values t from zero to infinity, p(t) with
%      p(t) = state.gazeRayLocal{i}.gazeC + t * state.gazeRayLocal{i}.gazeD
%      defines 3D points along the looking direction / gaze vector / gaze
%      ray of the subject, in a head-fixed reference frame.
%
%      Mathematical intersection of such a defined line equation p(t) with 3D
%      scene geometry in 3D rendering mode that is fixed wrt. to the users head
%      allows you to figure out where the user is looking in 3D space.
%
%      For a typical 3D head tracked VR / AR / MR rendering scenario, where
%      you would also set the the 'reqmask' flag +1 to retrieve head
%      tracking information and state.modelView matrices for 3D rendering,
%      the function also provides state.gazeRayGlobal{i} of the same
%      format. In this case the HMD head tracking information is used to
%      locate the subjects head position and orientation in a 3D rendered
%      scene and the gaze ray is transformed accordingly, so mathematical
%      intersection of rendered 3D geometry with the 3D line equation ...
%      p(t) = state.gazeRayGlobal{i}.gazeC + t * state.gazeRayGlobal{i}.gazeD
%      ... allows to find the point of fixation in a 3D world even if the
%      subject is moving their head or walking around.
%
%
%      Some of the supported eye tracking implementations may provide the
%      following additional optional information for each gaze index i. If
%      the information is not available for a given implementation, either
%      an empty vector [] or the scalar value NaN is returned:
%
%      state.gazeConfidence(i) = A scalar value of confidence, ie. how
%      certain is the gaze tracker that reported data is trustworthy and
%      accurate. Currently unsupported on all trackers, returns NaN.
%
%      state.gazeEyeOpening(i) = A scalar value of how far the subjects
%      eyes are open, in a normalized range 0 for closed to 1 for fully
%      open. This can be used, e.g., as another confidence measure, or for
%      eye blink detection. Supported for i=1,2 with HTC SRAnipal gaze
%      tracking on suitable HTC HMDs like the HTC Vive Pro Eye.
%
%      state.gazeEyePupilDiameter(i) = The estimated diameter of the
%      subjects pupil, presumably in millimeters. Supported for i=1,2 with
%      HTC SRAnipal gaze tracking on suitable HTC HMDs like the HTC Vive Pro Eye.
%
%      state.gazeEyeConvergenceDistance = For binocular gaze tracking, this
%      may be a scalar estimate of eye convergence distance, ie. the
%      distance of the fixation point from the eyes. May be supported on
%      some HTC HMDs under SRAnipal, but not confirmed in practice.
%
%
% More flags to follow...
%
%
% eyePose = PsychOpenXR('GetEyePose', hmd, renderPass [, userTransformMatrix][, targetTime]);
% - Return a struct 'eyePose' which contains various useful bits of information
% for 3D stereoscopic rendering of the stereo view of one eye, based on head or
% eye tracking data. This function provides essentially the same information as
% the 'PrepareRender' function, but only for one eye. Therefore you will need
% to call this function twice, once for each of the two renderpasses, at the
% beginning of each renderpass. NOTE: The function only exists for backwards
% compatibility with existing older VR/AR/XR scripts. It does *not* provide any
% benefit on OpenXR VR/AR/XR devices, but instead may cause a performance decrease
% when used! It is recommended to not use it in new scripts.
%
% 'hmd' is the handle of the device which delivers tracking data and receives the
% rendered content for display.
%
% 'renderPass' defines if information should be returned for the 1st renderpass
% (renderPass == 0) or for the 2nd renderpass (renderPass == 1). The driver will
% decide for you if the 1st renderpass should render the left eye and the 2nd
% pass the right eye, or if the 1st renderpass should render the right eye and
% then the 2nd renderpass the left eye. The ordering depends on the properties
% of the video display of your device, specifically on the video scanout order:
% Is it right to left, left to right, or top to bottom? For each scanout order
% there is an optimal order for the renderpasses to minimize perceived lag.
%
% 'targetTime' is the expected time at which the rendered frame will display.
% This could potentially be used by the driver to make better predictions of
% camera/eye/head pose for the image. Omitting the value will use a target time
% that is implementation specific, but known to give generally good results.
%
% 'userTransformMatrix' is an optional 4x4 right hand side (RHS) transformation
% matrix. It gets applied to the tracked head pose as a global transformation
% before computing results based on head pose like, e.g., camera transformations.
% You can use this to translate the "virtual head" and thereby the virtual eyes/
% cameras in the 3D scene, so observer motion is not restricted to the real world
% tracking volume of your headset. A typical 'userTransformMatrix' would be a
% combined translation and rotation matrix to position the observer at some
% 3D location in space, then define his/her global looking direction, aka as
% heading angle, yaw orientation, or rotation around the y-axis in 3D space.
% Head pose tracking results would then operate relative to this global transform.
% If 'userTransformMatrix' is left out, it will default to an identity transform,
% in other words, it will do nothing.
%
% Return values in struct 'eyePose':
%
% 'eyeIndex' The eye for which this information applies. 0 = Left eye, 1 = Right eye.
%            You can pass 'eyeIndex' into Screen('SelectStereoDrawBuffer', win, eyeIndex)
%            to select the proper eye target render buffer.
%
% 'modelView' is a 4x4 RHS OpenGL matrix which can be directly used as OpenGL
%             GL_MODELVIEW matrix for rendering the scene.
%
% 'cameraView' contains a 4x4 RHS camera matrix which describes position and
%              orientation of the "eye camera" relative to the world reference
%              frame. It is the inverse of eyePose.modelView. This matrix can
%              be directly used to define the camera for rendering of complex
%              3D scenes with the Horde3D 3D engine or other engines which want
%              absolute camera pose instead of the inverse matrix.
%
%
% oldType = PsychOpenXR('TrackingOriginType', hmd [, newType]);
% - Specify the type of tracking origin for OpenXR device 'hmd'.
% This returns the current type of tracking origin in 'oldType'.
% Optionally you can specify a new tracking origin type as 'newType'.
% Type must be either:
% 0 = Origin is at eye height (device height).
% 1 = Origin is at floor height.
% The eye height or floor height gets defined by the system during
% sensor calibration, possibly guided by some OpenXR GUI control application.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('SetupRenderingParameters', hmd [, basicTask='Tracked3DVR'][, basicRequirements][, basicQuality=0][, fov=[HMDRecommended]][, pixelsPerDisplay=1])
% - Query the device 'hmd' for its properties and setup internal rendering
% parameters in preparation for opening an onscreen window with PsychImaging
% to display properly on the device. See section about 'AutoSetupHMD' above for
% the meaning of the optional parameters 'basicTask', 'basicRequirements'
% and 'basicQuality'.
%
% 'fov' Optional field of view in degrees, from line of sight: [leftdeg, rightdeg,
% updeg, downdeg]. If 'fov' is omitted, the device runtime will be asked for a
% good default field of view and that will be used. The field of view may be
% dependent on the settings in the device user profile of the currently selected
% user. Note: This parameter is ignored with the current driver in 3D mode, ie.
% basicTask '3DVR' or 'Tracked3DVR' on any standard OpenXR 1.0 backend, as the
% driver auto-selects optimal field of view for 3D perspective correct rendering.
% In the 2D modes 'Monoscopic' or 'Stereoscopic', or in 3D mode with stopped loop,
% the specified field of view will be used for calculating position and size of the
% 2D views in use. If omitted the driver will try to auto-detect a meaningful field
% of view. If that is impossible, it will use the hard-coded values of an Oculus
% Rift CV-1 HMD as fallback. In all these cases, the 'PerEyeFOV' keyword will alter
% the method of default view setup from one that only takes the minimal vertical
% field of view min(updeg, downdeg) into account and calculates horizontal size to
% preserve stimulus image aspect ratio, to one that takes all field of view parameters
% into account, even if it causes distortions of shapes.
%
% 'pixelsPerDisplay' Ratio of the number of render target pixels to display pixels
% at the center of distortion. Defaults to 1.0 if omitted. Lower values can
% improve performance, at lower quality.
%
%
% PsychOpenXR('SetBasicQuality', hmd, basicQuality);

%
% Deprecated: This function does nothing. It just exists for (backwards)

%
%
% [bufferSize, imagingFlags, stereoMode] = PsychOpenXR('GetClientRenderingParameters', hmd);
% - Retrieve recommended size in pixels 'bufferSize' = [width, height] of the client
% renderbuffer for each eye for rendering to the device. Returns parameters
% previously computed by PsychOpenXR('SetupRenderingParameters', hmd).
%
% Also returns 'imagingFlags', the required imaging mode flags for setup of
% the Screen imaging pipeline. Also returns the needed 'stereoMode' for the
% pipeline.
%
%
% needPanelFitter = PsychOpenXR('GetPanelFitterParameters', hmd);
% - 'needPanelFitter' is 1 if a custom panel fitter task is needed, and the 'bufferSize'
% from the PsychVRHMD('GetClientRenderingParameters', hmd); defines the size of the

%
% [winRect, ovrfbOverrideRect, ovrSpecialFlags, ovrMultiSample, screenid] = PsychOpenXR('OpenWindowSetup', hmd, screenid, winRect, ovrfbOverrideRect, ovrSpecialFlags, ovrMultiSample);
% - Compute special override parameters for given input/output arguments, as needed
% for a specific device. Take other preparatory steps as needed, immediately before the

%
%
% isOutput = PsychOpenXR('IsHMDOutput', hmd, scanout);
% - Returns 1 (true) if 'scanout' describes the video output to which the

  % OpenGL context at a time can lock and use such a texture, but we don't
  % have any control over locking, as this is hidden inside the OpenXR
  % runtimes (xrAcquire/Wait/ReleaseSwapchainImage implementations). With
  % the "OpenXR OpenGL work context on one thread only at a time" - which
  % is neccessarily the presenterThread in multi-threaded mode, makes it
  % almost impossible to also use such a OpenXR swapchain image texture as
  % finalizedFBO backing for Screen's stimulus rendering and post-
  % processing --> Resource locking disasters and other monsters will come
  % out! We work around this by keeping the XrSwapchain textures away from
  % Screen: Instead we use Screen's own backing textures for the
  % finalizedFBO's, only use OpenXR textures in the presenterThread, and
  % then inside the presenterThreads releaseImages function, we copy the
  % rendered stimulus from Screen's finalizedFBO texture to the OpenXR
  % swapchain texture -- one extra full stimulus image copy per present!
  % Not good for performance, but this way Screen does not have to touch
  % OpenXR stuff, and the OpenXR thread's bound OpenXR work OpenGL context
  % can read from the texture shared with Screen, and write to the OpenXR
  % textures. Cfe. special code in PsychOpenXRCore's releaseTextureHandles()

      % Perform an eye gaze tracking query via OpenXR extensions. We don't

      % bundled within HTC's installed driver software for Vive devices
      % into the Matlab/Octave process, as HTC's OpenXR gaze tracking
      % extension is just a thin wrapper around HTC's SRanipal api and
      % runtime, specifically their XR_EXT_eye_gaze_interaction extension
      % simply calls SRanipal's GetEyeData_v2() function, then translates
      % and returns the data in OpenXR format. As our SRAnipalMex file also
      % has a load-time dependency on SRanipal.dll, this should allow our
      % mex file to load and link without trouble - or so goes the theory:
