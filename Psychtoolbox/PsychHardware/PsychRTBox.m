% Driver for the USTC reaction time button box (RTBox) by Xiangrui Li et al.
% varargout = PsychRTBox(cmd, varargin);
%
% This driver allows to control most functions of the USTC RTBox response
% button box. In theory this driver should support boxes up to Box/Firmware
% version 5. In practice it has only been tested by the Psychtoolbox
% developer up to firmware and box version 1.3, therefore you may encounter
% bugs for later versions. The box itself comes bundled with an alternative
% driver called "RTBox" which is maintained by the developers of the box
% hardware itself, in case this driver doesn't work with your box or
% firmware.
%
% The RTBox is a USB device which provides 4 response buttons (pushbuttons)
% for subject responses and can report any button press- or release by the
% subject. Additionally it has an input for reporting of external
% electronic trigger signals and a photo-diode input for reporting of
% visual stimulus onset. The box uses a built-in high-resolution clock to
% timestamp all button- or trigger events, independent of the host
% computers clock in order to make it more reliable for response time
% measurements than most other response devices. It also buffers all events
% internally, so experiment scripts can read back events when it is most
% convenient. Timestamps can be either reported in Psychtoolbox standard
% GetSecs timebase for direct comparison with timestamps from GetSecs,
% WaitSecs, KbCheck et al., Screen('Flip') and PsychPortAudio, etc. This
% simplifies reaction time calculations. Timestamps can also be reported in
% the timebase of the boxe, e.g., time of a button press relative to the
% photo-diode light trigger signal or electronic trigger signal, if this is
% more convenient for a given experiment setup.
%
% Current versions of the RTBox have additional functionality, e.g., more
% digital trigger inputs, some sound trigger, and TTL trigger outputs.
%
% See http://lobes.osu.edu/rt-box.php for up to date product information and
% additional driver software.
%
% Please note that while the device documentation claims that the external
% electronic pulse port is able to receive TTL trigger signals, we couldn't
% verify that this is the case with our test sample of version 1 of the
% RTbox hardware. While the pulse input port responded to some pulses sent
% by one TTL compatible device, it failed to detect the majority of signals
% from TTL most other test devices.
%
% This indicates that the pulse port may not be fully TTL compliant and
% will need additional tinkering for your setup. However, results with
% later versions of the hardware may be different than our experience with
% our test sample.
% 
%
% The following subcommands are currently suppported:
% ===================================================
%
%
% handle = PsychRTBox('Open' [, deviceID] [, skipSync=0]);
% -- Try to open a connected RTBox, return a device handle 'handle' to it
% on success. The handle can be used in all further subcommands to refer to
% the box. By default, all USB ports (or rather USB-Serial ports) are scanned
% for a connected RTBox and the driver will connect to the first box found.
% Alternatively you can specify which box to use via the optional
% 'deviceID' namestring. This can be either the name of a box, or the name
% of the USB-Serial port to which the box is connected. This way you can avoid
% scanning of all ports and disambiguate in case multiple boxes are
% connected to your computer.
%
% Btw., if you only make use of one single RTBox, you don't need to specify
% the 'handle' parameter to all following subfunctions. Instead you can
% specify that parameter as [] or omit it and the driver will use the only
% open box connected.
%
% The optional parameter 'skipSync', if set to 1, will prevent the open
% routine from performing an initial clock synchronization. By default, it
% will perform an initial clock synchronization.
%
% After opening the box, you may want to invoke this method:
%
%
% clockRatio = PsychRTBox('ClockRatio' [, handle] [, durationSecs]);
% -- Perform a clock drift calibration between the computers GetSecs host
% clock and the internal clock of the box 'handle'. Restrict calibration to
% a maximum of 'durationSecs' (default 60 seconds if omitted). Return the
% computed 'clockRatio' and use it for all further operations.
%
% Due to manufacturing imperfections and environmental factors, no two
% clocks ever run at exactly the same speed. Therefore the computer clock
% and box clock will slowly "drift out of sync" under normal conditions,
% rendering retrieved event timestamps inaccurate over the course of a long
% experiment session. This calibration routine will exercise the clocks and
% compute the clock drift due to this speed difference, then use the
% computed drift (= clockRatio) to correct all reported timestamps for this
% drift, thereby providing the accuracy needed for reaction time studies.
%
% The clockRatio value tells, how many seconds of GetSecs time elapse when
% the box clock measures 1 second elapsed time. Ideally this value would be
% 1, ie. both clocks run at the same speed. A more realistic value would be,
% e.g., 1.000009 -- The computer clock goes 9 microseconds faster than the
% box clock, so the drift will accumulate an error of 9 microseconds for
% each elapsed second of your study.
%
% As every calibration, this routine involves some measurement/calibration
% error and is therefore not perfect, so even after a successfull
% 'ClockRatio' calibration, timestamps reported during your experiment will
% accumulate some error during the course of long experiment sessions.
%
% There are multiple ways to handle this:
%
% a) Use a long calibration time in this function for accurate results, and
% a reasonably short experiment duration.
%
% b) Repeat this procedure after every large block of trials, ie., every
% couple of minutes, e.g., while the subject is allowed to take a break in
% a long experiment session.
%
% c) Use the PsychRTBox('SyncClocks') function after each short block of
% trials, or even after each trial, for the highest accuracy.
%
% d) Don't care for clock drift throughout the experiment session, just
% collect the event timestamps in box clock format (see the 3rd return
% argument of PsychRTBox('GetSecs') or the returned timing array of
% PsychRTBox('BoxSecs');) and store them in some array. Remap all timestamps
% into the computers GetSecs time at the end of your session via
% PsychRTBox('BoxsecsToGetsecs'). This requires a bit more
% discipline from you in programming and organizing your data, but it
% provides the most accurate timestamps.
%
%
% [syncResult, clockRatio] = PsychRTBox('SyncClocks' [, handle]);
% -- Synchronize or resynchronize the clocks of the host computer and the
% box. Return result in 'syncResult' and the current clockRatio in
% 'clockRatio'. This routine is automatically carried out during invocation
% of PsychRTBox('ClockRatio'); but you can repeat the sync procedure
% anytime between trials via this subfunction for extra accuracy at the
% expense of about 0.5 - 1 second additional time for each invocation. You
% would typically execute this function at the start of each large block of
% trials, or before start of each trial if you are really picky about
% super-exact timing. The syncResult contains three values:
%
% syncResult(1) = Host time (GetSecs time) at time of clock sync.
%
% syncResult(2) = Box time at time of clock sync.
%
% syncResult(3) = Confidence interval for the accuracy of the sync. This
% value (in seconds) provides a reliable upper bound for the possible error
% introduced in all reported timestamps from the box. The real error may be
% significantly smaller, this is just an upper bound that you can check.
% Typical results on a well working system should be in the sub-millisecond
% range, e.g., 0.0003 seconds or 0.3 msecs. Typical results on a rather
% noisy system would be around 0.001 second or 1 msec. Results worse than 2
% msecs indicate some problem with your system setup that should be fixed
% before executing any experiment study which involves reaction time
% measurements. By default, the sync procedure will abort with an error if
% it can't calibrate to an accuracy with a maximum error of 1.3 msecs within
% a duration of 0.5 seconds. You can change these default constraints with
% a call to PsychRTBox('SyncConstraints').
%
%
% [oldmaxDurationSecs, oldgoodEnoughSecs, oldrequiredSecs, oldsyncMethod] = PsychRTBox('SyncConstraints'[, maxDurationSecs][, goodEnoughSecs][, requiredSecs][, syncMethod]);
% -- Change the constraints to apply during calls to PsychRTBox('SyncClocks');
% Optionally return old settings.
%
% 'maxDurationSecs' limits any call to 'SyncClocks' to a duration of at
% most the given number of seconds. Calibration aborts after at most that
% time, even if unsuccessfull - in that case with an error message. By
% default, the duration is limited to 0.5 seconds.
% 'goodEnoughSecs' Calibration will finish before 'maxDurationSecs' have
% elapsed, if the result is more accurate than an error of at most
% 'goodEnoughSecs'. By default, this is set to zero seconds, i.e.,
% calibration will always take 'maxDurationSecs'.
% 'requiredSecs' - The calibration will only use samples with an
% uncertainty of at most 'requiredSecs'. If not even a single sample of the
% required precision can be acquired within 'maxDurationSecs', the call
% will fail with an error, indicating that your system setup doesn't
% provide the required timing precision for your demands. By default, the
% minimum required precision is 0.0013 seconds, ie., it will tolerate an
% error of at most 1.3 msecs.
% 'syncMethod' - Select the synchronization method to use. Either, method 0
% (prewrite sync), or method 1 (postwrite sync), or method 2 (average). If
% you want to know the difference between the methods, please consult the
% source code of this file and read the code for the subroutine 'function
% syncClocks'. All three methods are robust and accurate within the
% returned confidence window, usually better than 1 msec. So far, method 1
% seems to get the best results on our test setups, so this is the default
% for the current driver release. However, we are still evaluating if
% method 0 would be a tiny bit better and worth switching the default to
% that.
%
%
% oldverbose = PsychRTBox('Verbosity' [, handle], verbosity);
% -- Set level of verbosity for driver: 0 = Shut up. 1 = Report errors
% only. 2 = Report warnings as well. 3 = Report additional status info. 4 =
% Be very verbose about what is going on. The default setting is 3 --
% Report moderate status output.
%
%
% devinfo = PsychRTBox('BoxInfo' [, handle] [, newdevinfo]);
% -- Return a struct 'devinfo' with all information about the current
% status and parameter settings for RTBox 'handle'. Optionally set a new
% struct with updated parameters via 'newdevinfo'. This function is mostly
% useful for debugging and benchmarking the driver itself. Most information
% contained in 'devinfo' will be useless for your purpose.
%
%
% PsychRTBox('Close', handle);
% -- Close connection to specific box 'handle'. Release all associated
% ressources.
%
%
% PsychRTBox('CloseAll');
% -- Close connections to all attached RTBox devices. Reset the PsychRTBox
% driver completely. You'll usually use this function at the end of your
% experiment script to clean up.
%
%
% oldeventspec = PsychRTBox('Enable' [,handle][, eventspec]);
% -- Enable specified type of event 'eventspec' on box 'handle'. This
% allows to enable detection and reporting of a specific type of event. By
% default, only reporting of push-button press is enabled, as this is the
% most common use of a response box.
%
% The following names are valid for the name string 'eventspec':
% 'press' = Report push-button press. This is the default setting.
% 'release' = Report push-button release.
% 'pulse' = Report electronic trigger events on external input port.
% 'light' = Report reception of light flashes by photo-diode on light port.
% 'tr' = Report reception of scanner trigger "TR" (TTL input from pin 7 of DB-9 port).
% 'all' = Enable all events.
%
% If called without the 'eventspec' parameter, the function will return the
% names of all currently enabled events.
%
%
% oldeventspec = PsychRTBox('Disable' [,handle][, eventspec]);
% -- Disable specified type of event 'eventspec' on box 'handle'. This
% allows to disable detection and reporting of a specific type of event. By
% default, only reporting of push-button press is enabled, as this is the
% most common use of a response box.
%
% See 'Enable' call for help on parameters.
%
%
% Once you have setup and calibrated the box and selected the type of
% events to detect and report, you will want to actually retrieve
% information about events. For this you use these commands:
%
%
% PsychRTBox('Start' [, handle] [, dontwaitforstart=0]);
% -- Start event detection and reporting by the box. The box will start
% detecting button and trigger events from here on and record them in the
% event buffer.
% 
% You will usually call this at the beginning of a response period. By
% default, the box has reporting already enabled after 'Open'ing it.
%
% The optional 'dontwaitforstart' parameter, if set to 1, will ask the
% 'Start' function to return control as soon as possible, ie., without
% waiting for confirmation of the box that event reporting has actually
% started. By default, the routine waits for an acknowledgement from the
% box, which can take 16 - 30 msecs in some cases.
%
%
% PsychRTBox('Stop' [, handle]);
% -- Stop event detection and reporting by the box. The box will ignore
% detecting button and trigger events from here on and no longerrecord them
% in the event buffer.
% 
% You will usually call this at the end of a response period.
%
%
% PsychRTBox('Clear' [, handle] [, syncClocks=0] [, dontRestart=0]);
% -- Stop event detection and reporting by the box, clear all recorded
% events so far, then restart reporting if it was active before calling
% this function.
% 
% Instead of calling 'Start' and 'Stop' to mark the start and end of a
% response period in a trial you can also simply use this function at the
% beginning of a trial (or its response period) to discard any stale data
% from a previous trial (or non-response interval).
%
% You can prevent an automatic restart of event reporting by setting the
% optional flag 'dontRestart' to a value of 1.
%
% You can ask the box to resynchronize its clock to the host computer clock
% by setting the optional flag 'syncClocks' to a value of 1. This is the
% same as calling PsychRTBox('SyncClocks').
%
%
% [time, event, boxtime] = PsychRTBox('GetSecs' [, handle] [, interTimeout=0.1] [, maxTimeout=interTimeout] [, maxItems=inf]);
% -- Retrieve recorded events from the box 'handle'.
%
% By default, as many events are returned as are available within the
% test interval, but you can select a specific number of wanted events
% by setting the optional parameter 'maxItems'. If there aren't any pending
% events from the box, by default the driver waits for up to 0.1 seconds
% for events to arrive. You can change this 'interTimeout' interval via the
% positive (non-zero) 'interTimeout' parameter. The function will return if
% no new events show up within 'interTimeout' seconds. If something shows
% up, the deadline for return is extended by 'interTimeout' seconds. You
% can set an absolute upper limit to the response interval via the
% 'maxTimeout' parameter. That defaults to 'interTimeout' if omitted.
% Please note that after an event is detected by the box, up to 16-32 msecs
% can elapse until the event is received by the computer, so you may not
% want to set these timeout values too small!
%
% The function will return an array of timestamps in 'time', and an array
% of corresponding names of the events in 'event'. E.g., event(1) will
% report the identity of the first detected event, e.g., '1' if button 1
% was pressed, whereas time(1) will tell you when the event happened, ie.,
% when button 1 was pressed. 'time' is expressed in host clock time, aka
% GetSecs() time. If no events are pending since last invocation of this
% function, empty vectors will be returned.
%
% Additionally, the vector 'boxtime' contains the same timestamp, but
% expressed in box clock time. See below for a use of that.
%
% By default, the following names are possible for 'event's:
%
% '1' = 1st button pressed, '1up' = 1st button released.
% '2' = 2nd button pressed, '2up' = 2nd button released.
% '3' = 3rd button pressed, '3up' = 3rd button released.
% '4' = 4th button pressed, '4up' = 4th button released.
% 'pulse' = electronic pulse received on electronic pulse input port.
% 'light' = Light pulse received by photo-diode connected to light input port.
% 'tr' = Scanner trigger "TR" (TTL input from pin 7 of DB-9 port) received.
% 'serial' = PsychRTBox('Trigger') Softwaretrigger signal received on USB-Serial port.
%
% Note: 'tr' is only supported on boxes with Firmware version 3.0 or later.
%
% However, you can assign arbitrary names to the buttons and events if you
% don't like this nomenclature via the PsychRTBox('ButtonNames') command.
%
% The reported timestamps are expressed in host clock time, ie., in the
% same units as the timestamps returned by GetSecs, Screen('Flip'),
% PsychPortAudio, KbCheck, KbWait, etc., so you can directly calculate
% reaction times to auditory stimuli, visual stimuli and other events.
%
% See the help for PsychRTBox('SyncClocks') and PsychRTBox('ClockRatio')
% for the accuracy of these timestamps and tips for obtaining optimal
% accuracy.
%
% Additionally the event times are also returned in 'boxtime', but this
% time expressed in box time -- the time of the box internal clock.
% 
%
% There are multiple variants of this query command with the same optional
% input arguments, but different return arguments. All of these return
% timestamps in box time without remapping to GetSecs time by calling:
%
% [boxtime, event] = PsychRTBox('BoxSecs' ...);
% -- Timestamps are in raw box clock time, everything else is the same as
% in PsychRTBox('GetSecs' ...).
%
% If you have the 'boxtime' timestamps from one of the previous functions
% around, you can map them later to GetSecs time with very high precision
% at the end of your experiment session via:
%
% [GetSecs, Stddev] = PsychRTBox('BoxsecsToGetsecs' [, handle], boxTimes);
% -- Perform a post-hoc mapping of a vector of raw box timestamps
% 'boxTimes' into a vector of host clock 'GetSecs' timestamps. Return some
% error measure in 'Stddev' as well, if available.
%
% This method can be used to convert event timestamps expressed in the box
% clocks timebase into timestamps in Psychtoolbox GetSecs host clock
% timebase. It has the advantage of providing the highest possible accuracy
% in mapping, because it computes an optimal mapping function for this
% purpose, which is based on all the timing information collected
% throughout a whole experiment session. The disadvantage is that it will
% only provide meaningful results if you call it at the end of your
% experiment session, so you'll need to manage all your collected
% timestamps in a format that is suitable as input to this function.
%
%
% Timestamps can also be returned relative to a specific trigger event: You
% specify which event acts as a trigger. Then all timestamps of all events
% are expressed relative to the time of that trigger event, i.e., as
% deltas. Any event can be the trigger. Format of all arguments is
% as in PsychRTBox('BoxSecs' ...);
%
% E.g., PsychRTBox('serial', ...); Returns timestamps relative to the first
% occurence of a electronic input port trigger signal since the last query.
% PsychRTBox('light', ...); Returns timestamps relative to photo-diode
% light pulse. PsychRTBox('1'); returns relative to press of 1st button,
% etc. etc.
%
%
% sendTime = PsychRTBox('SerialTrigger' [, handle]);
% -- Send a software generated trigger to the box via the serial port
% connection. This will register as a event of type 'serial' and you can
% retrieve timestamps relative to the first trigger within a response
% period via the PsychRTBox('serial', ...); command.
%
%
% sendTime = PsychRTBox('EngageLightTrigger [, handle]);
% sendTime = PsychRTBox('EngagePulseTrigger [, handle]);
% sendTime = PsychRTBox('EngageTRTrigger [, handle]);
% 
% -- Engage trigger input on the box for reception of a one-shot trigger
% signal. This function will return immediately after submitting the
% request to the box. It may take up to 5 msecs worst-case until the
% trigger input is really enabled. If you want to wait for the trigger to
% be really enabled, call, e.g., PsychRTBox('Enable', handle, 'lighton'); instead,
% as that function will wait until the trigger is really active.
%
% Trigger events are special: If a trigger has been received, the
% box auto-disables the trigger input, preventing reception of any
% further trigger events, until the trigger gets reenabled. The trigger gets
% reenabled on many occasions if it has been enabled once via the
% PsychRTBox('Enable', ...); command, e.g., at each call to
% PsychRTBox('Start'); or PsychRTBox('Clear'). If you want to enable the
% trigger on-the-fly, then this function is your friend.
%
% The reason why light trigger auto-disables itself is because a typical
% CRT display monitor would generate such trigger signals at the rate of
% video refresh, once your stimulus is displayed, e.g., at a rate of 100
% Hz. Usually you only want to know one defined timestamp of initial
% stimulus onset, therefore the box prevents reception of all but the
% first light trigger.
%
% Similar reasoning applies to Pulse and TR triggers.
%
%
% oldNames = PsychRTBox('ButtonNames' [, handle] [, newNames]);
% -- Query or assign labels for the four response box buttons other than
% the default names.
%
% This function allows to assign arbitrary names to the four buttons on the
% box. These names are reported when querying for button presses and
% releases. By default, oldNames = PychRTBox('ButtonNames') would return
% the cell array with the four following names: '1', '2', '3', '4'. These
% are the names reported for button presses. Button releases would report
% the names with an 'up' appended, ie., '1up', '2up', '3up', '4up'. You can
% assign arbitrary new names by passing a cell array with four namestrings,
% e.g., PsychRTBox('ButtonNames', [], {'7', 'whats', 'hick', 'screw'})
% would assign the names '7', 'whats', 'hick' and 'screw' for button press
% events, and '7up', 'whatsup', 'hickup' and 'screwup' for release events
% of the corresponding buttons.
%
% Please note that the assignment of names to buttons must be unique, ie.
% assigning the same name to multiple buttons is not allowed.
%
%
% oldIntervals = PsychRTBox('DebounceInterval' [, handle] [, debounceSecs]);
% -- Query current button debounce intervals (in 4-element vector
% 'oldIntervals', one value for each button), and optionally set new
% debounce interval in seonds via the optional argument 'debounceSecs'.
% 'debounceSecs' can be a scalar, in which case the same setting is applied
% to all buttons, or a 4-element row vector, e.g., [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1] to
% set an individual interval for each of the four buttons.
%
% The built-in debouncer prevents multiple button responses (button press
% or release actions) from getting recorded/reported within some
% 'debounceSecs' debounce interval. After a button has changed state, only
% the type (press or release), identity (which button) and timestamp (when)
% of the first state change is reported. Any other state change within
% 'debounceSecs' seconds of time after that first change will be ignored.
% After that time has elapsed, further state changes are reported again. By
% default, this dead "debounce" interval is set to 0.050 seconds, ie., 50
% msecs. Button bouncing happens if a subject presses or releases a button
% very rapidly or vigorously. If such quick multiple events or bounces are
% not ignored, they will create multiple apparent button responses which
% are a hazzle to deal with in experiment scripts and data analysis.
%
% If you find multiple responses generated for only one apparent button
% press during piloting, you may want to set a bigger debounce interval
% with this function.
%
% Please note that debouncing doesn't apply to the PsychRTBox('ButtonDown')
% function.
%
% Please also note that there is another hardware debouncer with a duration
% of 0.3 msecs on RTBox versions with firmware versions 1.3 and older, which
% can't be disabled, so even if you'd set a zero interval here, you'd still
% get a minimum 0.3 msecs debounce period from the hardware itself.
%
% Later versions of the firmware support the following
% PsychRTBox('HardwareDebounce') command to control the hardware debounce
% interval more fine-grained.
%
%
% [oldValue] = PsychRTBox('HardwareDebounce' [, handle] [, scanNum]);
% -- Set/get hardware debouncer setting. The hardware will treat a button
% event as valid only if the button state stays stable for at least
% 'scanNum' scanning iterations of the firmware. The scan interval is about
% 67 microseconds. The valid scanNum is from 1 through 255, with a default
% setting of 16 cycles for 1.072 msecs debounce interval.
%
% For software debouncing at the driver level, see PsychRTBox('DebounceInterval')
% above. 
% 
%
% buttonState = PsychRTBox('ButtonDown' [, handle] [, whichButtons]);
% -- This reports the current button state of all response buttons of box
% 'handle', or a subset of response buttons if specified by the optional
% 'whichButtons' argument, e.g., whichButton = {'1', '4'} to only test
% buttons 1 and 4. 'buttonState' is a vector which contains a 1 for each
% pressed button, and a zero for each released button.
%
% This query is as instantaneous and "live" as possible. The reported state
% is not subject to button debouncing, but the measured "raw state".
% Usually you will want to use the PsychRTBox('GetSecs' ...) functions ans
% similar functions to query timestamped button state. They are typically
% as fast as this method and they provide timestamps of when the state was
% queried, whereas this function doesn't give you information about how
% "fresh" or recent the query is. However for simple button queries outside
% the response interval, e.g., while the box is PsychRTBox('Stop')'ped with
% no need for timestamps, this may be an option.
%
% Due to the design of the USB bus, the query may be outdated wrt. to the
% real state by up to 16 - 21 msecs, depending on operating system and
% driver configuration.
%
%
% buttonState = PsychRTBox('WaitButtonDown' [, handle] [, whichButtons]);
% -- Wait until at least one of the specified buttons in 'whichButtons' is

%
%
% [timeSent, confidence] = PsychRTBox('TTL' [, handle] [, eventCode=1]);
% - Send TTL to DB-25 port (pin 8 is bit 0). The second input is event code
% (default 1 if omitted), 4-bit (0~15) for box versions < 5, and 8-bit
% (0~255) for later versions. It can also be equivalent binary string, such
% as '0011'.
%
% The optional return arguments are the 'timeSent' when the TTL update was
% performed, and an upper bound on the uncertainty 'confidence' of
% 'timeSent'.
%
% The width (duration) of the TTL pulse is controlled by the
% PsychRTBox('TTLWidth') command.
%
% This function is only supported for v3.0 RTBoxes and later, the ones with
% EEG event code support.
%
% 
% [oldValue] = PsychRTBox('TTLWidth' [, handle][, widthSecs]);
% - Set/get TTL pulse width in seconds. The default width is 0.97e-3, ie.
% 97 microseconds when the device is opened. The actual width may have some
% small variation. The supported width ranges from 0.14e-3 to 35e-3 secs. A
% infinite width 'inf' is also supported. Infinite width means the TTL will
% stay until it is changed by the next PsychRTBox('TTL') command, such as
% PsychRTBox('TTL',0).
%
% This function is only supported for v3.0 RTBoxes and later, the ones with
% EEG event code port support.
%
% In Version <5.0, the TTL width at DB-25 pins 17~24 is controlled by a
% potentiometer inside the box. In Version >= 5, the width is also
% controlled by 'TTLWidth' command. 
% 
%
% [oldValue] = RTBox('TTLResting' [, handle][, newLevel]);
% - Set/get TTL polarity for DB-25 pins 1~8. The default is 0, meaning the
% TTL resting is low. If you set newLevel to nonzero, the resting TTL will
% be high level. If you need different polarity for different pins, let us
% know. This function is only supported with firmware version 3.1 and
% later.
% 
% In Version 5.0 and later, newLevel has second value, which is the
% polarity for pins 17~24.

% 02/08/2009 Huge redesign of API and internal routines. Now we use an
%            internal queue (MK).
% 02/14/2009 Refinements and cleanup (MK).
% 02/15/2009 More refinements and rework of post-hoc timestamp remapping (MK).
% 06/07/2009 Check for ambiguous assignment of buttonnames to avoid errors.
%            Bug found by Vinzenz Schoenfelder (MK).
% 06/14/2009 Remove special case code for Octave. No longer needed (MK).
% 12/14/2009 Update for RTBox'es with firmware v1.4 and later:
%
%            * Store box firmware version numerically for easier comparison.
%
%            * v >= 1.4 sends '?' acknowledge for live button query before
%              the byte that reports buttons state --> Handle this.
%
%            * Detect clock frequency of RTBox and adapt our bytes2secs() mapping
%              accordingly for V1.4 and later.
%
%            * 'lightoff' event is dead, now its called 'tr' instead for TR
%              scanner trigger reception on new V3.0 firmware boxes.
%
%            * Switch v1.3 and later boxes back to 'x' simple E-Prime et
%              al. compatible mode at PsychRTBox('close') time.
%
%            * Support new 'hardwaredebounce' command on v1.4+
%
%            * Support new 'ttlwidth' for v3.0, 'ttlresting' for v3.1+
%
%            * Support 4-bit TTL out port for v3.0+
%
%            * Add fast-engage commands for pulse and TR triggers as well.
%
% 10/20/2011 Switch fast calibration from robustfit to polyfit() - Now we
%            always use polyfit() in all cases to avoid need for Matlab
%            statistics toolbox. The PostHoc routine always did this, but
%            the online routine didn't. (MK)
%
% 11/26/2011 Updates for Firmware versions up to V5 (MK):
%
%            * TTL out is now 8 bit capable and 'ttlwidth' and 'ttlresting'
%              needed to be updated as well.
%            * Event enable handling has changed.
%            * Various other stuff.
%
%            None of this is tested due to lack of hardware/firmware.
%
% 01/06/2012 Bugfix for Firmware versions >= 4.1. Did not receive events
%            due to wrong acknowledgement handling. (MK)

% Map box timestamps to host clock (aka GetSecs) timestamps, based on clock

    global rtbox_info;

    thostbase = rtbox_info(id).sync(1);
    tboxbase  = rtbox_info(id).sync(2);

    % Compute delta in box seconds from time when calibration was
    % done, wrt. box timer, then multiply with clockRatio
    % conversion factor to translate that delta into a delta wrt.
    % host clock, so timing will be the delta in host clock seconds
    % wrt. calibration time:
    timing = (timing - tboxbase) * rtbox_info(id).clkRatio;

    % Add basetime on host - this should give us correctly mapped
    % time in the GetSecs timebase of the computer:
    timing = timing + thostbase;
end

% sync results from all syncClocks samples from a session:

    % Stop box, if active, drain all queues. Please note that we don't
    % auto-restart the box, because this method is meant to be only called
    % at the end of an experiment session, so usercode must manually
    % restart if it wants to:
    stopBox(id);
    
    % Check if the latest syncClocks sample is older than 30 seconds. If
    % so, then we acquire a new final sample. We also resample if the last
    % sample is of too low accuracy, or if there are less than 2 samples in
    % total, as the fitting procedure needs at least 2 samples to work:
    while (size(rtbox_info(id).syncSamples, 1) < 2) || ...
          ((GetSecs - rtbox_info(id).syncSamples(end, 1)) > 30) || ...

      % Perform a syncClocks to get a fresh sample to finalize the sampleset:

    % MK: Change of strategy: We always use polyfit() instead of sometimes
    % regress() or robustfit() for the following reasons:
    %
    % 1. Strategy switching may introduce artifacts / non-predictable
    % behaviour into the results.
    %
    % 2. A simple polyfit() is better understood than the more advanced
    % robustfit() with its tons of tunable parameters and strategies, for
    % which i don't know which are appropriate for our data.
    %
    % 3. robustfit() and regress() require the Matlab statistics toolbox
    % and therefore won't work on a plain standard Matlab installation,
    % whereas polyfit() is part of default Matlab and Octave.
    %

    %     else
    
    % Use polyfit, i.e., a least squares fit of a polynomial of either
    % degree 1 (purely linear), or degree 2 (quadratic). We choose a purely
    % linear fit if only 2 samples are available - the best we can do. If
    % more than 2 samples are available, we use a quadratic fit to account
    % for small non-linearities in the clock hardware over long intervals:

            % offset between postwrite host clock time and box clock time at
            % receive of sync command. The reasoning behind this goes like this:
            %
            % 1) The time offset between host clock and box clock is a constant -
            % at least within a significant multi-second time interval between
            % successive syncClocks calls (due to only small clock drift), but
            % certainly within a syncClocks run of a few hundred milliseconds
            % (error due to clock drift in this interval is negligible).
            %
            % 2) Computed box clock time t(3,:) is "close to perfect", as this
            % timestamp is taken by box microprocessor and firmware with a very
            % small and basically constant delay after sync token receive, ie.,
            % write completion. (Maximum theoretical error is smaller than 0.1 msecs).
            %
            % 3) The correct and optimal clock offset between host and box would be
            % tdiff = tsend - t(3,:) iff tsend would be host time at true write
            % completion.
            %
            % 4) The measured host time at write completion t(2,:) is always later
            % (and therefore numerically greater) than the true host time tsend at
            % write completion due to an unknown, random, greater than zero delay
            % tdelta, i.e., t(2,:) = tsend + tdelta, tdelta > 0. tdelta is the sum
            % of:
            %
            % a) The unknown delay of up to 1 msec between USB write-URB completion
            % by the USB host controller (which would be the real completion time
            % tsend) and detection of completion due to USB IOC (Interrupt-On-
            % Completion) due to invocation of the host controllers hardware
            % interrupt handler and host controller schedule scan and URB
            % retirement inside the interrupt handler.
            %
            % b) Random (and theoretically unbounded) scheduling delay / execution
            % delay between status update of the serial port data structures by the
            % interrupt handler and detection of write completion + timestamping by
            % the IOPort driver in polling mode, or scheduling delay between
            % wakeup-operation caused by the interrupt handler and start of
            % execution of the timestamping in the IOPort driver in blocking mode.
            %
            % The syncClocks error is therefore directly proportional to the size
            % of tdelta. Therefore:
