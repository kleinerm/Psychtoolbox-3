# Example xorg.conf file for a muxless dual-gpu system,
# e.g., a muxless Laptop, where an Intel iGPU is used
# to drive the experimenter/GUI display on X-Screen 0,
# an AMD dGPU is used to drive the visual stimulation
# display on X-Screen 1. This setup could be found on
# a Laptop where the iGPU is not connected to the external
# display outputs - it is only driving the internal
# Laptop flat panel. The dGPU is connected only to the
# external outputs - it is only driving external displays,
# e.g., for visual stimulation.
# In such a case the best setup is to assign one X-Screen
# to each gpu, like demonstrated here. You would need to
# adapt this xorg.conf to your specific hardware though,
# e.g., select proper BusId parameters for your hardware.
#
# The most common muxless laptops nowadays only have the
# iGPU connected to *all* display outputs (internal and
# external), the dGPU is not connected to anything. For
# that config, Psychtoolbox XOrgConfCreator can automatically
# create suitable config files for so called DRI/Prime render
# offload. Iow. for such Laptops this example config or similar
# ones do not apply.
