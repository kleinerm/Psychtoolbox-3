function T_absorbance = StockmanSharpeNomogram(S,lambdaMax)% T_absorbance = StockmanSharpeNomogram(S,lambdaMax)%% Compute normalized absorbance according to the% nomogram provided by Stockman and Sharpe:% http://cvrl.ioo.ucl.ac.uk/database/text/pigments/sstemplate.htm.%% From email from Stockman, expanding on the original web page/paper% description:%%   The common or average template for the three photopigment optical density%   spectra () for the log wavelength scale is:% %    POLYNOMIAL HERE% %   where x is log10(l), and l is the wavelength in nm,% %    PARAMETERS HERE%%   The template was derived iteratively by aligning the S-cone and M-cone photopigment%   with the L-cone photopigment spectra and then finding the best-fitting polynomial%   to describe the aligned spectra. The mean template has a lmax of 558.0 nm.% %   For other lmax values the template should be shifted along a log wavelength scale. In general, then:%   x=log10(l) - log10(lmax/558).% %   The lmax values of the fitted templates that best fits the original Stockman and Sharpe%   (2000) S-, M- and L-cone photopigment spectra are 420.7, 530.3 and 558.9 nm for the%   S-, M- and L-cones, respectively;% %   For further details, please see Equation 8 and the discussion in Stockman and Sharpe (2000).%% The result is in quantal units, in the sense that to compute% absorbtions you want to incident spectra in quanta.% To get sensitivity in energy units, apply EnergyToQuanta().%% Argument lambdaMax may be a column vector of wavelengths.%% As near as I can tell, this funciton implements the equations,% but I get crazy answers.
