%
% Function to compute normalized cone quantal sensitivities
% from underlying pieces and parameters.
%
% Note that this routine returns quantal sensitivities.  You
% may want energy sensitivities.  In that case, use EnergyToQuanta to convert
%   T_energy = EnergyToQuanta(S,T_quantal')'
% and then renormalize.  (You call EnergyToQuanta because you're converting
% sensitivities, which go the opposite directoin from spectra.)
%
% The routine also returns two quantal sensitivity functions.  The first gives
% the probability that a photon will be absorbed.  The second is the probability
% that the photon will cause a photopigment isomerization.  It is the latter
% that is what you want to compute isomerization rates from retinal illuminance.
% See note at the end of function FillInPhotoreceptors for some information about
% convention.  In particular, this routine takes pre-retinal absorption into
% account in its computation of probability of absorptions and isomerizations,
% so that the relevant retinal illuminant is one computed without accounting for
% those factors.  This routine does not account for light attenuation due to
% the pupil, however.  The only use of pupil size here is becuase of its
% slight effect on lens density as accounted for in the CIE standard.
%
% In the passed params structure, you can either pass
% the lambdaMax values for the photopigment, in which
% case the absorbance is computed from the specified
% nomogram, or you can pass the absorbance values
% directly in T_xxx format.  A typical choice in this
% case would be 10.^T_lgo10coneabsorbance_ss for the
% Stockman-Sharpe/CIE estimates.
%
% The typical use of this function is to be called by 
% ComputeCIEConeFundamentals, which sets up the
% passed structures acording to the CIE standard. 
% This routine, however, could in principle be used
% with a wide variety of choices of the component pieces.
%
% The other place this function is used is in attempts to
% fit a set of cone fundamentals by doing parameter search
% over the pieces.  It is this second use that led to the
% parameters being split over two separate structures, one
% that is held static during the fit and the other which
% contains the parameters that could be searched over by a calling
% routine.  For examples, see:
%   FitConeFundamentalsWithNomogram, FitConeFundamentalsTest.
% Looking around today (8/10/13), I (DHB) don't see any examples where
% this routine is called directly.  Rather, it is a subfunction
% called by ComputeCIEConeFundamentals.  The search routines above
% use ComputeCIEConeFundamentals, and only search over lambdaMax
% values.  I think I wrote this with the thought that I might one
% day search over more parameters, but lost motivation to carry it
% throught.
%
% The computations done here are very similar to those done in
% routine FillInPhotoreceptors.  I (DHB) think that I forgot about
% what FillInPhotoreceptors could do when I wrote this, which has
% led to some redundancy. FillInPhotoreceptors returns a field
% called effectiveAbsorptance, which are the actual quantal efficiencies
% (not normalized) referred to the cornea.  FillInPhotoceptors also
% computes a field isomerizationAbsorptance, which takes the quantal
% efficiency of isomerizations (probability of an isomerization given
% an absorption into acount.  This routine does not do that.
%
% It would probably be clever to unify the two sets of routines a
% little more, but we may never get to it.  The routine ComputeCIEConeFundamentals
% does contain a check that this routine and what is returned by FillInPhotoreceptors
% agree with each other, for cases where the parameters match.
