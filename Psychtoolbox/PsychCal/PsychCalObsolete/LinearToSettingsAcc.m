function [finalSettings,badIndex,quantized,perError,settings] = LinearToSettingsAcc(cal,linear)% [finalSettings,badIndex,quantized,perError,settings] = LinearToSettingsAcc(cal,linear)%% Convert from linear color space coordinates to device% setting coordinates.  This routine makes use of the% full basis function information to compensate for spectral% shifts in the device primaries with input settings.%% This depends on the standard calibration globals.%% LinearToSettingsAcc has been renamed "SensorToSettingsAcc".  The old% name, "LinearToSettingsAcc", is still provided for compatability % with existing scripts but will disappear from future releases % of the Psychtoolbox.  Please use SensorToSettingsAcc instead.%% See Also: PsychCal, PsychCalObsolete, SensorToSettingsAcc% 11/12/93   dhb      Wrote it.% 3/30/94	   dhb, jms Fixed logic bug in error computation.%					              Return finalSettings as best during iteration% 8/4/96     dhb      Update for stuff bag routines.% 8/21/97    dhb      Update for structures.% 3/10/98	   dhb      Change nBasesOut to nPrimaryBases.% 4/5/02     dhb, ly  Call through new interface.% 4/11/02    awi   Added help comment to use SensorToSettingsAcc instead.%                  Added "See Also"[finalSettings,badIndex,quantized,perError,settings] = SensorToSettingsAcc(cal,linear)
