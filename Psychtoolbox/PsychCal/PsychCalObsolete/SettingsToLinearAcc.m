function [linear,deviceE] = SettingsToLinearAcc(cal,settings)% [linear,deviceE] = SettingsToLinearAcc(cal,settings)%% Convert from device setting coordinates to% linear color space coordinates.  Uses full% basis function measurements in doing% conversions so that it can compensate for% device primary spectral shifts.%% SettingsToLinearAcc has been renamed "SettingsToSensorAcc".  The old% name, "SettingsToLinearAcc", is still provided for compatability % with existing scripts but will disappear from future releases % of the Psychtoolbox.  Please use SettingsToSensorAcc instead.%% See Also: PsychCal, PsychCalObsolete, SettingsToSensorAcc% 11/12/93  dhb   Wrote it.% 11/15/93  dhb   Added deviceE output.% 8/4/96    dhb   Update for stuff bag routines.% 8/21/97	  dhb	  Update for structures.% 3/10/98   dhb	  Change nBasesOut to nPrimaryBases.% 4/5/02    dhb   Call through new interface.% 4/11/02   awi   Added help comment to use SettingsToSensorAcc instead.%                 Added "See Also"[linear,deviceE] = SettingsToSensorAcc(cal,settings);
