function linear = DeviceToLinear(cal,device)% lineara = DeviceToLinear(cal,device)%% Convert from linear device coordinates to linear color % space coordinates.  The ambient lighting is added to% the color space coordinates of the device.%% This depends on the standard calibration globals.%% DeviceToLinear has been renamed "PrimaryToSensor".  The old% name, "DeviceToLinear", is still provided for compatability % with existing scripts but will disappear from future releases % of the Psychtoolbox.  Please use PrimaryToSensor instead.%% See Also: PsychCal, PsychCalObsolete, PrimaryToSensor%% 9/26/93    dhb   Added calData argument.% 10/19/93   dhb   Allow device characterization dimensions to exceed%                    device settings dimensions.% 11/11/93   dhb   Update for new calData routines.% 8/4/96     dhb   Update for new stuff bag routines.% 8/21/97	   dhb   Convert for structures.% 4/5/02     dhb   Call through new named version.% 4/20/02		 awi   Fixed typo bug where return argument variable did not%									 have the same name as the result computed within the function. % 4/11/02   awi   Added help comment to use PrimaryToSensor instead.%                 Added "See Also"linear = PrimaryToSensor(cal,device);
