% Checks if the two calibrations are the same.  Useful
% for preventing blunders if you have programs that
% precompute and save quantities based on monitor calibrations.
% In that case, this can be used to ensure that current 
% calibration matches the one used to do the pre-computing.
%
% Checks date/time, screen, and computer.  Could check the
% actual data, but that seems like overkill.
% 
% 9/17/97  pbe       Wrote it. 
% 9/18/97  pbe, dhb  Modify interface, change name.
% 1/16/98  dhb       Add any around string compares, necessary for desired effect.
% 1/21/98  dhb       Add IGNOREDATE flag.
% 3/10/98  dhb	     Change name to CompareMonCal.
% 7/3/98   dhb, pbe  Change for cal.describe format.
% 5/28/14  npc       Modifications for accessing calibration data using a @CalStruct object.
%                    The first two input arguments can be either a @CalStruct object (new style), or a cal structure (old style).
%                    Passing @CalStruct objects is the preferred way because it results in 
%                    (a) less overhead (@CalStruct objects are passed by reference, not by value), and
%                    (b) better control over how the calibration data are accessed.
