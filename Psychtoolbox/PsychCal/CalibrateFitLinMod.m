% 3/26/02   dhb  Pulled out of CalibrateMonDrvr.
% 3/27/02   dhb  Add case of nPrimaryBases == 0.
% 2/15/10   dhb  Fix so that first basis vector is good approximation to max
%               input primary spectrum.
%           dhb  Normalize basis vectors so that their max power matches that 
%               of first component.
% 4/30/10   dhb  Execute yoked fit if yokedGamma flag is set.
% 5/25/10   dhb, ar Change yoked field names to match
% 5/26/10   dhb, ar Still fussing with names.
% 5/28/10   dhb, ar Pull out yoked fitting from here -- too confusing.
% 5/27/12   dhb     Handle case where there are more measurements than wavelength samples.
