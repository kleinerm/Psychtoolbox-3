function PsychJavaTrouble(installStatic)
% PsychJavaTrouble -- What to do if Java-based Psychtoolbox functions fail?
%
% You probably arrived at this help text because of an error in execution
% of one of the Psychtoolbox Java based functions, e.g., ListenChar,
% CharAvail, GetChar or FlushEvents.
%
% There are four common reasons for failure of Java based Psychtoolbox
% functions:
%
% 1. You run Matlab in nojvm mode, i.e., you started Matlab via 'matlab
% -nojvm'. In that case, Matlabs Java virtual machine is disabled and so
% are all Java based Psychtoolbox functions. In that case you need to
% restart Matlab with its Java VM enabled.
%
% 2. You run GNU/Octave, which doesn't support our Java based keyboard
% functions. However, then you should not ever end here, as we use an
% alternate implementation on Octave.
%
% 3. The Psychtoolbox/PsychJava/ subfolder of your working copy of
% Psychtoolbox isn't included in Matlabs static Java classpath. The
% Psychtoolbox installer/upgrader (DownloadPsychtoolbox, SetupPsychtoolbox
% or UpdatePsychtoolbox, as well as DownloadAdditionsForLinux) usually
% tries to edit the 'classpath.txt' file, or since Matlab 8.1,
% 'javaclasspath.txt', of your Matlab installation in order to add the
% Psychtoolbox/PsychJava subfolder to Matlabs classpath. This procedure may
% fail due to insufficient access permissions on your system. You can
% verify this by entering 'type classpath.txt' at the Matlab prompt. The
% printed file should contain the path to the PsychJava folder. If it
% doesn't, you may want to edit the file yourself ('which classpath.txt'
% tells you the location of the file) or ask a system administrator to do
% it for you. After editing the file you need to restart Matlab. Instead of
% manual editing you can also call this function as PsychJavaTrouble(1); -
% This will try to automatically modify the classpath.txt or
% javaclasspath.txt file if your Matlab runs with sufficient permissions,
% e.g., administrator permissions.
%
% If you need a quick temporary fix for the problem, other than editing
% classpath.txt and restarting Matlab, then type 'PsychJavaTrouble' at the
% Matlab command prompt. The function will add the PsychJava folder to the
% dynamic classpath to immediately enable Java based Psychtoolbox
% functions. This fix is temporary however, it needs to be repeated after
% each restart of Matlab. Executing the command will also clear all
% variables and functions from Matlabs workspace (like 'clear all'), so
% adding it to experiment scripts may impair proper working of that
% scripts.
%
% 4. You didn't restart Matlab after the Psychtoolbox installer asked you
% to do so. -> Restart Matlab and retry.
%
% 5. The versions of GetCharJava bundled with Psychtoolbox are incompatible
% with the version of Java installed on your machine or bundled with your
% version of Matlab. If you have a Java SDK installed on your machine,
% Psychtoolbox will try to compile a matching version of GetCharJava. This
% should succeed on OS-X but is unlikely to work on Windows, because that
% system does not have a javac compiler installed by default.
%
% 6. Other reasons: Post to the Psychtoolbox forum and ask for help.
%
% Good luck!
