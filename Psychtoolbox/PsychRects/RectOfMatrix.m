function rect = RectOfMatrix(mat)% rect = RectOfMatrix(mat)%% Accept an image as a matrix and return a Psychtoolbox rect specifying % the bounds.%% See also: SetRect, PsychRects% HISTORY% 6/28/04   awi Wrote it.% 7/13/04   awi Improved documentation.  % 1/29/05   dgp Renamed from RectFromMatrix to RectOfMatrix. % 1/29/05   dgp Timed it. RectOfMatrix is quick, taking about 100 µs, %               independent of matrix size.[m,n]=size(mat);rect=[0 0 n m];
