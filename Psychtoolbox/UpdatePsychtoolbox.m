function UpdatePsychtoolbox(targetdirectory, targetRevision)
% UpdatePsychtoolbox(targetdirectory, targetRevision)
%
% Update your working copy of the Psychtoolbox with the latest bug fixes,
% enhancements, and features from the master server.
%
% If you are using a Psychtoolbox provided by NeuroDebian, this is not
% needed. You will be automatically notified of updates to Psychtoolbox by
% your operating systems update manager as soon as they become available.
%
% The "targetdirectory" argument is optional. If present, it gives the path
% of the Psychtoolbox folder to update. If omitted, UpdatePsychtoolbox will
% update the Psychtoolbox folder found by Matlab's or Octave's "which"
% command. For example:
%
% UpdatePsychtoolbox
% UpdatePsychtoolbox('~/Applications/Psychtoobox')
%
% The "targetRevision" argument is optional and should be normally omitted.
% Normal behaviour is to upgrade your working copy to the latest revision.
% If you provide a specific targetRevision, then this script will
% *downgrade* your copy of Psychtoolbox to the specified revision. This is
% only useful if you experience problems after an update and want to revert
% to an earlier known-to-be-good release. Revisions can be specified by a
% revision number, a specific date, or by the special flag 'PREV' which
% will downgrade to the revision before the most current one. By executing
% this script multiple times with the 'PREV' specifier, you can
% incrementally downgrade until stuff works for you.
%
% UpdatePsychtoolbox cannot change the beta-vs-stable flavor of your
% Psychtoolbox. To change the flavor, run DownloadPsychtoolbox again.

% History:
%
% 11/2/05 mk  Created.
% 1/13/06 mk  Added support for Microsoft Windows.
% 3/13/06 dgp Allow explicit targetdirectory argument.
%             Changed default to use WHICH instead of PWD as
%             targetdirectory. Update MATLAB path. Expand comments.
% 5/08/06 mk  Small fixes. Added option to downgrade to a specific revision.
% 9/23/06 mk  Add clear mex call to flush mex files before updating.
% 10/5/06 mk  Add detection code for MacOS-X on Intel Macs.
% 21/11/06 mk Add improved detection code for Subversion.
% 31.3.08 mk  Allow spaces in path to targetdirectory (Fix contributed by Tobias Wolf)
%  7.5.08 mk  Allow to spec 'targetdirectory' as [], so it gets default.
%
% 10/01/08 mk  Add interactive output/query for svn client on the Unices.
%              This to work-around questions of the client about accepting
%              security certificates...
% 01/05/09 mk  Remove && or || to make old Matlab versions happier.
% 05/31/09 mk  Add support for Octave-3.
% 10/05/09 mk  Strip trailing fileseperator from targetDirectory, as
%              suggested by Erik Flister to avoid trouble with new svn
%              clients.
% 05/27/12 mk  Strip backwards compatibility support to pre-R2007a.
%              Remove PowerPC support.
%
% 09/14/12 mk  Drop support for Octave on MS-Windows.
% 09/14/12 mk  Drop support for 32-Bit Octave on OSX.
% 07/02/13 mk  Drop support for 32-Bit Matlab on OSX, and thereby for 32-Bit OSX.
% 05/18/14 mk  No support for 32-Bit Matlab on Linux and Windows anymore for 3.0.12.

% work if Screen et al. are still loaded.
