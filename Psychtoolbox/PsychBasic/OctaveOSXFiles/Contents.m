% Psychtoolbox:PsychBasic:OctaveOSXFiles
%
% This folder contains the binary plugins for running Psychtoolbox under
% GNU/Octave on MacOS/X IntelMac. OCT files are the counterparts to Matlabs
% MEX-Files -- Compiled C code.
%
% All OCT files for all platforms end with the same .oct extension, therefore
% all files have the same name, regardless of architecture. For that reason
% we place files for different OS/Hardware architectures into different folders
% to avoid name clashes. Octave is clever enough to select the proper files
% from the proper folder at runtime.
%
% For a description of the files, just refer to the info about the corresponding
% Matlab MEX files in PsychBasic and other places. Same thing - only runtime
% environment is different.

% History:
% 1.4.2007  Created (MK).
