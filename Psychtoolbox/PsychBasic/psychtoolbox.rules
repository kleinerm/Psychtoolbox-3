# These are Linux udev rules (man udev) that setup device access permissions on your
# Linux system so that unprivileged user processes like Matlab and Octave - and thereby
# Psychtoolbox - can access pieces of hardware relevant to Psychtoolbox.
#
# This allows to run Matlab/Octave safely as non-root user (without the "sudo" command)
# and thus have full access to Linux low-level functionality.
#
# This file should be copied to /etc/udev/rules.d/ on a Debian/Ubuntu compatible/derived
# Linux distribution. It has been tested on Ubuntu Linux 10.10. After copying the
# file you need to reboot your machine once for all settings to take effect.

# Rules to allow Psychtoolbox to access the MMIO registers of all supported GPU's
# while running inside an unprivileged Matlab/Octave userspace process without sudo root:

# For each attached ATI GPU, set the permissions on its resource2/5 files to o+rw to allow mapping BAR-2 and BAR-5 from unprivileged userspace apps like Psychtoolbox:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{class}=="0x030000", ATTR{vendor}=="0x1002", RUN+="/bin/chmod o+rw %S%p/resource2"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{class}=="0x030000", ATTR{vendor}=="0x1002", RUN+="/bin/chmod o+rw %S%p/resource5"

# For each attached AMD GPU, set the permissions on its resource2/5 file to o+rw to allow mapping BAR-2 and BAR-5 from unprivileged userspace apps like Psychtoolbox:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{class}=="0x030000", ATTR{vendor}=="0x1022", RUN+="/bin/chmod o+rw %S%p/resource2"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{class}=="0x030000", ATTR{vendor}=="0x1022", RUN+="/bin/chmod o+rw %S%p/resource5"

# For each attached NVidia GPU, set the permissions on its resource0 file to o+rw to allow mapping BAR-0 from unprivileged userspace apps like Psychtoolbox:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{class}=="0x030000", ATTR{vendor}=="0x10de", RUN+="/bin/chmod o+rw %S%p/resource0"

# For each attached Intel GPU, set the permissions on its resource0 file to o+rw to allow mapping BAR-0 from unprivileged userspace apps like Psychtoolbox:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{class}=="0x030000", ATTR{vendor}=="0x8086", RUN+="/bin/chmod o+rw %S%p/resource0"
# Intel GEN-2 hardware uses BAR-1 instead of BAR-0, therefore need to enable it as well:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", ATTR{class}=="0x030000", ATTR{vendor}=="0x8086", RUN+="/bin/chmod o+rw %S%p/resource1"

# Make devices from "Cambridge Research Systems" accessible by unprivileged user processes:
ATTR{manufacturer}=="CRS Ltd", MODE="0666"
ATTR{idVendor}=="0861", MODE="0666"

# Make devices from "VPixx Inc." accessible by unprivileged user processes:
ATTR{manufacturer}=="VPixx", MODE="0666"

# Set latency timer of FTDI serial-over-usb chips to 1 msec, as this is used by
# our PsychRTBox.m driver and similar drivers for low-latency data reception over
# FTDI USB serial ports. We have this here just as a backup. The IOPort driver itself
# will set the latency_timer to 1 msecs if 'ReceiveLatency' is set to a value <= 0.001
# seconds. Yet another way to do it is to use the user-callable shell command:
# "setserial /dev/ttyUSB0 low_latency"
# On current Linux kernels, this isn't strictly needed, because the ftdi_sio
# kernel driver inits low-latency mode on its devices by default since kernel 2.6.31
# from June 2009:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb-serial", DRIVER=="ftdi_sio", ATTR{latency_timer}="1"

# Enable non-root access of libusb to the USB-HID DAQ devices supported by the DAQ toolbox:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="09db", MODE="0666"

# Enable non-root access of libusb to the USB-3 PointGrey IIDC cameras:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1e10", MODE="0666"

# Enable non-root access of libusb to the USB-HID interface of the Occulus Rift DK2 HMD:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2833", MODE="0666"

# Enable non-root access of libusb to the NVIDIA 3D Vision USB IR Emitter:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="0955", ATTR{idProduct}=="0007", MODE="0666"

# Add a /dev/input/powermate symlink, with non-root access for all for the Griffin PowerMate USB knob,
# which is controlled by the Linux powermate kernel driver. Additionally allow non-root access to the
# /dev/eventXX file, in case multiple PowerMates are in use.
ACTION=="add", ENV{ID_USB_DRIVER}=="powermate", SYMLINK+="input/powermate", MODE="0666"
ACTION=="add", ENV{ID_USB_DRIVER}=="powermate", MODE="0666"

# Enable non-root access of libusb to the Griffin PowerMate:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="077d", ATTR{idProduct}=="0410", MODE="0666"
