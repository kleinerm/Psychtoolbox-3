% [nx, ny, textbounds, cache, wordbounds] = DrawFormattedText2(tstring, key-value pairs)
% or:
% [nx, ny, textbounds, cache, wordbounds] = DrawFormattedText2(cache, key-value pairs)
% 
% When called with a string, the following key-value pairs are understood:
% win [, sx][, sy][, xalign][, yalign][, xlayout][, baseColor][, wrapat][, transform][, vSpacing][, righttoleft][, winRect][, resetStyle][, cacheOnly]
% Those enclosed in square braces are optional.
% 
% When called with a cache struct, the following optional key-value pair
% arguments are accepted:
% [, win][, sx][, sy][, xalign][, yalign][, transform][, winRect][, cacheOnly]
% 
% example call:
% DrawFormattedText2('test text', 'win',window_pointer,'baseColor',[255 0 0])
% 
% Draws a string of text 'tstring' into Psychtoolbox window 'win'. Allows
% some formatting and precise positioning. Only works with the FTGL-based
% text plugin (see help DrawTextPlugin), activate it with
% Screen('Preference','TextRenderer', 1);
% This function is _not_ made to be fast. Test carefully if you want it to
% work within a screen refresh if you throw a lot of text at it.
%
% The text string 'tstring' may contain newline characters '\n'.
% Whenever a newline character '\n' is encountered, a linefeed and
% carriage return is performed, breaking the text string into lines.
%
% The text may also contain the formatting tags listed below. Each tag
% changes the formatting of the text from that point onward. Tags do not
% need to be closed. At the exit of the function, the state of the font
% renderer (font, text size, etc) is reset to the state upon function entry
% or the state stored in the cache if drawing from cache.
% - <i>:                toggles italicization
% - <b>:                toggles bolding
% - <u>:                toggles underlining
% - <color=colorFmt>    switches to a new color
% - <font=name>         switches to a new font
% - <size=number>       switches to a new font size
% The <i>, <b> and <u> tags toggle whether text is italicized, bolded or
% underlined and remain active (possibly until the end of the input string)
% until the same <i>, <b> or <u> tag is encountered again.
% The <color>, <font> and <size> tags can be provided empty (i.e., without
% argument), in which case they cause to revert back to the color, font or
% size active before the previous switch. Multiple of these in a row go
% back further in history (until start color, font, size is reached).
% To escape a tag, prepend it with a slash, e.g., /<color>. If you want a
% slash right in front of a tag, escape it by making it a double /:
% //<color>. No other slashes should be escaped.
% <color>'s argument can have one of two formats, it can either be a
% hexadecimal string (HEX), or a comma-separated floating point array
% (FPN). If a HEX input is provided, it should encode colors using a 1, 2,
% 6 or 8 hexadecimal digit string. If 1 or 2 digits are provided, this is
% interpreted as a grayscale value. 6 hexadecimal digits are interpreted as
% R, G and B values (2 digits each). 8 digits further includes an alpha
% value. Using the HEX values, color values range from 0 to 255. Example:
% <color=ff0000> changes the text color to red (ff corresponds to 255). The
% FPN format consists of 1, 3 or 4 comma separated floating point color
% values (luminance, RGB, or RGBA) that can take on any value, but will be
% processed according to the current color settings for the window as
% indicated by Screen('ColorRange'). Typically, the values provided will
% range from 0.0--1.0 per component. Floating point values should include
% the decimal point to ensure that single element FPN values are parsed
% correctly. Examples: <color=1.,0.,0.> and <color=.5>. If a floating point
% value is specified but Screen('ColorRange') returns 255, indicating 8bit
% color values are used for the window, the floating point color values
% provided are automatically scaled and rounded to the 0-255 range. If the
% HEX format is used but Screen('ColorRange') returns 1.0, indicating
% floating point color values are used for the window, the uint8 color
% values are automatically converted to the 0.0-1.0 range.
% A size/font command before a newline can change the height of the line on
% which it occurs. So if you want to space two words 'test' and 'text'
% vertically by white space equivalent to an 80pts line, use:
% 'test\n<size=80>\n<size>text'. There is an empty line between the two new
% lines, and the size=80 says that this line has height of 80pts in the
% selected font.
%
% 'sx' and 'sy' provide a location on the screen with respect to which the
% textbox is positioned. 'sx' and 'sy' can be a pixel location provided as
% a number. Alternatively, 'sx' can also be 'left' (default), 'center', or
% 'right' signifying the left side, horizontal middle, or right side of the
% window rect. 'sy' can also be 'top' (default), 'center', or 'bottom'
% signifying the top, vertical middle, or bottom of the window rect. 
%
% 'xalign' and 'yalign' are text strings indicating how the textbox should
% be aligned to the screen location provided in 'sx' and 'sy'. For
% 'xalign', 'left' (default), signifies that the left of the text's
% bounding box is aligned to the screen location; 'center' that the
% bounding box is centered on this location; and 'right' that the right of
% the text's bounding box is aligned with this location. For 'yalign',
% 'top' (default), signifies that the top of the text's bounding box is
% aligned to the screen location; 'center' that the bounding box is
% centered on this location; and 'bottom' that the bottom of the text's
% bounding box is aligned with this location.
%
% 'xlayout' indicates how each line is positioned horizontally in the
% bounding box. If 'left' (default), all lines are aligned to the left of
% the text's bounding box; if 'center', all lines are centered in the
% bounding box; and if 'right', all lines are aligned to the right of the
% bounding box. Justification options are currently not supported.
%
% 'baseColor' is the color in which the text will be drawn (until changed
% by a <color> format call). This is also the color that will remain active
% after invocation of this function.
%
% 'wrapat', if provided, will automatically break text strings longer than
% 'wrapat' characters into newline separated strings of roughly 'wrapat'
% characters. This is done by calling the WrapString function (See 'help
% WrapString'). 'wrapat' mode may not work reliably with non-ASCII text
% strings, e.g., UTF-8 encoded uint8 strings on all systems. It also does
% not necessarily lead to lines of roughly equal length, unless using a
% monospace font.
%
% 'transform' allows transforming the text to be drawn as a whole. The
% 'transform' input is a cell array of key-value parameters, indicating
% which transform to do in which order. The following transform are
% supported:
% 'translate', [dx dy]: translates text by dx horizontally and dy
%                       vertically
% 'flip', axis        : mirrors text horizontally if axis is 1, vertically
%                       if axis is 2, and along both axes if number is 3
%                       (which is equal to a 180 deg rotation)
% 'scale', [sx sy]    : scale text horizontally by sx and vertically by sy.
%                       Set to 1 if you want no scaling.
% 'rotate', angle     : Rotate text by angle (degrees). Note that for the
%                       PTB screen, a positive rotation is clockwise.
% example {'translate',[100 0],'rotate',45} first translates text by 100
% pixels, then rotates it by 45 degree clockwise. Note that the order of
% operations is important. The above is equal to
% {'rotate',45,'translate',100*sqrt([2 2])/2}. Advanced note: for OpenGL
% transform are applied in the reverse order from how they're specified.
% That is not the case for this interface, transform are applied in the
% order specified.
%
% The optional argument 'vSpacing' sets the spacing between the lines.
% Default value is 1.
%
% The optional argument 'winRect' allows to specify a [left top right
% bottom] rectange, in which the text should be placed etc. By default, the
% rectangle of the whole 'win'dow is used.
%
% 'resetStyle'. If true, we reset the base text style to normal before
% interpreting formatting commands that are present in the input text
% string. If not (false), active text style at function entry is taken into
% account when processing style toggle tags
%
% 'cache'. Upon invocation of the function, it provides an optional output
% 'cache'. Providing this output back to DrawFormattedText2 instead of the
% 'tstring' input allows direct drawing of the exact same text without all
% the preprocessing having to be done again, potentially saving significant
% time (and simplifying the call syntax). In this mode, a subset of the
% below arguments can be used to, e.g., draw to a different window or
% reposition the text. This cache can be generated without any actual
% drawing being done by setting the 'cacheOnly' argument to true. The cache
% is an implementation detail and is subject to change at any time.
% When drawing from cache, the text can be repositioned with the 'sx',
% 'sy', 'xalign', 'yalign' and 'winRect' inputs described above. If only
% 'sx' and 'sy' are provided, these are taken to be offsets to move the
% bounding box of the cached text. 'sx' and 'sy' must be numerical in this
% case and cannot be empty. If 'xalign' and/or 'yalign' are provided,
% full-fledged parsing of 'sx', 'sy', 'xalign' and 'yalign' is done, same
% as during a normal call to DrawFormattedText2. The bounding box is then
% repositioned according to these for inputs. The winRect argument is only
% used in this case. It is optional (defaulting to the whole windows), and
% works as described above, specifying the rect to which 'xalign' and
% 'yalign' apply. The input option 'transform' can furthermore be set,
% which appends additional transformations to what is already in the cache.
%
%
% Return variables:
%
% The function returns the new (nx, ny) position of the text drawing cursor
% and the bounding rectangle 'textbounds' of the drawn string. (nx,ny) can
% be used as new start position for connecting further text strings to the
% bottom of the drawn text string. Calculation of textbounds is
% approximative, so it may give wrong results with some text fonts and
% styles on some operating systems, depending on the various settings. The
% optional 'cache' output argument is discussed above.
%
% When rotating by angles that are not a multiple of 90 degrees, the
% bounding box may not be accurate (too large). The returned bounding box
% is the rect that tightly fits the rotated original bounding box, not the
% box that tightly fits the rotated ink of the letters.
%
% The optional return argument 'wordbounds', if assigned in the calling
% function, returns a n-by-4 matrix of per-word bounding boxes. Each row
% defines a [left,top,right,bottom] rectangle with the bounding box of a
% word in the text string, ie. row 1 = first word, row 2 = 2nd word, ...
% white-space characters delimit single words, as do style changes and line-
% feeds, and these delimiters are not taken into account for the bounding box,
% ie. they don't get their own bounding boxes. The white-space separating
% successive words is as defined by the function isspace(tstring), or by a
% change of text style, color, formatting, etc. Use of 'wordbounds' may cause
% a significant slow-down in text drawing, so only assign this return argument
% if you actually need it. A current limitation is that returned bounding boxes
% will be likely incorrect if you apply multiple transformations like 'scale'
% 'rotate', 'translate' and 'flip' at once. A single transformation will work,
% but multiple ones will cause misplaced per word bounding boxes. If you want
% to get proper 'wordbounds' when drawing text from the 'cache' then you must
% assign 'wordbounds' already in the DrawFormattedText2() invocation which
% returns the 'cache', otherwise bounding boxes might be wrong.
%
% One difference in the return values from this function and
% DrawFormattedText is that the new (nx, ny) position of the text drawing
% cursor output is the baseline of the text. So to use (nx,ny) as the new
% start position for connecting further text strings, you need to draw
% these strings with yPositionIsBaseline==true. Another difference is that
% the returned textbounds bounding box includes the height of an empty line
% at the end if the input string ended with a carriage return.
% DrawFormattedText only moved (nx,ny) but did not include the empty line
% in the bounding box. The empty line is also taken into account when
% centering text
%
%
% Further Notes:
% 
% Please note that while positioning and bounding boxes are pixel accurate
% with the fonts tested during development, i cannot guarantee this is the
% case with all fonts you throw at it. Also note that this function is not
% made to be fast. It has a make draw from cache mode so that all
% preprocessing is done only once and stored in a cache from which the text
% can be drawn directly. Nonetheless, especially if you throw a lot of
% formatting at it, this function may still not be fast in this mode. Use
% with caution in timing critical paths (test and measure to know if its
% fast enough). That said, with reasonable inputs it should manage to draw
% text to screen well within the inter frame interval of most screens.
%
% The function employs clipping by default. Text lines that are detected as
% laying completely outside the 'win'dow or optional 'winRect' will not be
% drawn, but clipped away. This allows to draw multi-page text (multiple
% screen heights) without too much loss of drawing speed. If you find the
% clipping to interfere with text layout of exotic texts/fonts at exotic
% sizes and formatting, you can define the global variable...
% global ptb_drawformattedtext2_disableClipping;
% ... and set it like this ...
% ptb_drawformattedtext2_disableClipping = 1;
% ... to disable the clipping.
%
% Regardless of the clipping setting, the optional 3rd return parameter
% 'textbounds' always covers the complete text.
%
% See DrawFormattedText2Demo for a usage example.
