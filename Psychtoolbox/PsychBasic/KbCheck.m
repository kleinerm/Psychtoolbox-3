% Return keyboard status (keyIsDown), time (secs) of the status check, and

% 
%    keyIsDown      1 if any key, including modifiers such as <shift>,
%                   <control> or <caps lock> is down. 0 otherwise.
% 
%    secs           Time of keypress as returned by GetSecs.
% 
%    keyCode        A 256-element logical array.  Each bit
%                   within the logical array represents one keyboard key. 
%                   If a key is pressed, its bit is set, othewise the bit 
%                   is clear. To convert a keyCode to a vector of key  
%                   numbers use FIND(keyCode). To find a key's keyNumber 
%                   use KbName or KbDemo.
% 
%    deltaSecs      Time in seconds since this KbCheck query and the most
%                   recent previous query (if any). This value is in some
%                   sense a confidence interval, e.g., for reaction time
%                   measurements. If KbCheck returns the information that a
%                   key is pressed by the subject, then the subject could
%                   have pressed the key down anytime between this
%                   invocation of KbCheck at time 'secs' and the most
%                   recent previous invocation. Therefore, 'deltaSecs'
%                   tells you about the interval in which depression of the
%                   key(s) might have happened: [secs - deltaSecs; secs].
%                   for practical purpose this means that "measured" RT's
%                   can't be more accurate than 'deltaSecs' seconds - the
%                   interval between the two most recent keyboard checks.
%                   Please note however, that standard computer keyboards
%                   can incur additional delays and timing uncertainty of
%                   up to 50 msecs, so the real uncertainty can be higher
%                   than 'deltaSecs' -- 'deltaSecs' is just a lower bound!
%
% KbCheck and KbWait determine whether any key is down now, including the
% meta keys: <caps lock>, <shift>, <command>, <control>, and <option>. The
% only key not reported is the start key (triangle) used to power on your
% computer.
% 
% Some users of Laptops experienced the problem of "stuck keys": Some keys
% are always reported as "down", so KbWait returns immediately and KbCheck
% always reports keyIsDown == 1. This is often due to special function keys.
% These keys or system functionality are assigned vendor specific
% key codes, e.g., the status of the Laptop lid (opened/closed) could be
% reported by some special keycode. Whenever the Laptop lid is open, this key
% will be reported as pressed. You can work around this problem by passing
% a list of keycodes to be ignored by KbCheck and KbWait. See
% "help DisableKeysForKbCheck" on how to do this.
%
% Keys pressed by the subject often show up in the Matlab command window as
% well, cluttering that window with useless character junk. You can prevent
% this from happening by disabling keyboard input to Matlab: Add a
% ListenChar(2); command at the beginning of your script and a
% ListenChar(0); to the end of your script to enable/disable transmission of
% keypresses to Matlab. If your script should abort and your keyboard is
% dead, press CTRL+C to reenable keyboard input -- It is the same as
% ListenChar(0). See 'help ListenChar' for more info.
%
% GetChar and CharAvail are character-oriented (and slow), whereas KbCheck
% and KbWait are keypress-oriented (and fast). If only a meta key was hit,
% KbCheck will return true, because a key was pressed, but CharAvail will
% return false, because no character was generated. See GetChar.
% 
% KbCheck and KbWait are MEX files, which take time to load when they're
% first called. They'll then stay loaded until you flush them (e.g. by
% changing directory or calling CLEAR MEX).
%
% KbCheck uses the PsychHID function, a general purpose function for
% reading from the Human Interface Device (HID) class of USB devices.
%
% KbCheck queries the first USB-HID keyboard device by default. Optionally,
% when multiple keyboards are attached to your machine, you can pass in a
% 'deviceNumber':  When 'deviceNumber' is -1, KbCheck will query all
% keyboard devices and return their "merged state" - The 'keyCode' vector
% will represent the state of all keys of all keyboards, and the
% 'keyIsDown' flag will be equal to one if at least one key on any of the
% keyboards is pressed. When 'deviceNumber' is -2, KbCheck will query all
% keypad devices (if any) and return their "merged state", and when
% 'deviceNumber' is -3, KbCheck will query all keyboard and keypad devices
% and return their "merged state". When 'deviceNumber' is greater than 0, it
% will query only the specified HID keyboard device corresponding to that
% 'deviceNumber'. The function GetKeyboardIndices() allows to query the
% device numbers of all attached keyboards, or keyboards matching specific
% criteria, and the function GetKeypadIndices() allows the same for keypads.
%
% On MS-Windows 2000 and earlier, KbCheck can address individual keyboards.
% On Windows-XP and later, it can't.
%
% To save time, PsychHID and KbCheck enumerate the devices and count keyboards
% only once, and cache the answer. If you add or remove a keyboard during a
% running experiment session, you must flush their caches. Otherwise the new
% keyboard won't noticed or KbCheck may issue a fatal error trying to access
% a non-existent keyboard. However, in general it is a rather bad idea to allow
% addition or removal of devices during a running session, as various other
% Psychtoolbox functions may also cache devices and device settings and get
% confused by such surprising changes in hardware configuration.
%
%   clear PsychHID; % Force new enumeration of devices.
%   clear KbCheck; % Clear persistent cache of keyboard devices.
%
% As a little bonus, KbCheck can also query other HID human input devices
% which have keys or buttons as if they were keyboards. If you pass in the
% deviceIndex of a mouse (GetMouseIndices will provide with them), it will
% report mouse button state as keyboard state. Similar behaviour usually
% works with Joysticks, Gamepads and other input controllers.

% TO DO:
%
%  - Mention that on USB systems there the USB bus is sampled at 100 Hz.
