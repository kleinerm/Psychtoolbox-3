function err = Snd(command,signal,rate,sampleSize)% err = Snd(command,[signal],[rate],[sampleSize])% % Snd('Play',signal,[rate]) plays a sound.% OS9: Unlike Matlab's SOUND command, Snd returns immediately, while the % sound is still playing. The queue can have up to 128 sounds, so% calling Snd('Play',signal) while a sound is already playing adds the new% sound to the queue. % WIN & OSX: Snd calls the built-in MATLAB SOUND. Also see AUDIOPLAYER % and PLAY.% % rate=Snd('DefaultRate') returns the default sampling rate in Hz, which% currently is 22254.5454545454 Hz on all platforms. This default may% change in the future, so please either specify a rate, or use this% function to get the default rate.%% Before playing, Snd internally converts the matrix of double-precision % floating-point values passed in the signal argument to either an array % of 8-bit or 16-bit values. The optional sampleSize argument used with % Snd('Play') specifies which.  Allowable values are either 8 or 16.  If % no value is specified then Snd defaults to 16. %% Snd('Open') opens the channel, which stays open until you call% Snd('Close'). Snd('Play',...) automatically opens the channel if it% isn't already open. (At present the WIN & OSX version ignores the 'Open'% command.)% % Snd('Close') immediately stops all sound and closes the channel. (This% happens automatically whenever Snd.mex is flushed, e.g. by "CLEAR Snd"% or "CLEAR MEX".)% % Snd('Wait') waits until all the sounds in the channel play through.% % isPlaying=Snd('IsPlaying') returns true (number of sounds in channel) if% any sound is playing, and false (0) otherwise.% % Snd('Quiet') stops the sound currently playing and flushes the queue,% but leaves the channel open.% % "signal" may either be a numeric array of samples, or a string giving% the name of a Macintosh snd resource in the System file (or Matlab% application or MEX file). (Use the Sound control panel to see what Alert% Sounds are available.)% % Your "signal" data should lie between -1 and 1 (smaller to play more% softly). If the "signal" array has one row then it's played monaurally,% through both speakers. If it has two rows then it's played in stereo.% (Snd has no provision for changing which speaker(s), or the volume, used% by a named snd resource, so use READSND to get the snd into an array,% and supply the appropriately modified array to Snd.)% % "rate" is the rate (in Hz) at which the samples in "signal" should be% played. We suggest you always specify the "rate" parameter. If not% specified, the sample "rate", on all platforms, defaults to OS9's% standard hardware sample rate of 22254.5454545454 Hz. That value is% returned by Snd('DefaultRate'). Other values can be specified (in the% range 1000 to 65535 Hz); linear interpolation is used to resample the% data. Currently the "rate" is ignored when you specify the sound by% name.% % OSX & WIN: "samplesize". Snd accepts the sampleSize argument and passes % it to the Matlab SOUND command.  SOUND (and therefore Snd also) obeys the% specified sampleSize value, either 8 or 16, only if it is supported by % your computer hardware. % % Snd('Play',sin(0:10000)); % play 22 KHz/(2*pi)=3.5 kHz tone% Snd('Play',[sin(1:20000) zeros(1,10000);zeros(1,10000) sin(1:20000)]); % stereo% Snd('Play','Quack');      % play named snd resource% Snd('Wait');         		% wait until end of all sounds currently in channel% Snd('Quiet');        		% stop the sound and flush the queue% % At present, the OS9 channel's queue can hold up to 128 sounds (which% could easily be increased--let us know). If the queue is full % when you call Snd('Play',signal),% Snd waits until there is room (i.e. the current sound ends) and then% adds its sound to the queue and returns. You can break out of that wait% by hitting Command-Period.% % Snd is similar to the Matlab SOUND command (and PlaySound.mex created by% Malcolm Slaney of Apple Computer) with two enhancements: immediate% (asynchronous) return and playing of named snd resources. SOUND and% SoundPlay operate synchronously, i.e. they return only after the sound% ends. Snd uses the VideoToolbox SndPlay1.c routine to play sounds% asynchronously, i.e. return immediately, while the sound is still% playing. Asynchronous operation is important in many psychophysical% applications, because it allows you to play a sound during a dynamic% visual stimulus.% % For most of the commands, the returned value is zero when successful, % and a nonzero Apple error number when Snd fails. The Apple error % number can be looked up, e.g. in Easy Errors, available from:% <http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/NewSearch?key=Easy+Errors>% % OS9: Snd('Play',signal) takes some time to open the channel, if it isn't% already open, and allocate a snd structure for your sound. This overhead% of the call to Snd, if you call it in the middle of a movie, may be% perceptible as a pause in the movie, which would be bad. % (There is no opening overhead in the WIN & OSX version.) However, the% actual playing of the sound, asynchronously, is a background process% that usually has very little overhead. So, even if you want a sound to% begin after the movie starts, you should create a soundtrack for your% entire movie duration (possibly including long silences), and call Snd% to set the sound going before you start your movie. (Thanks to Liz Ching% for raising the issue.)% % NOTE: When you specify a snd by name, you cannot specify a volume, but% there is an easy work-around. As explained in the following paragraph,% use ResEdit and READSND to get the snd into an array. When you play% a snd from an array, you can control the volume by scaling the array.% (Thanks to Larry James for asking.)% % NOTE: Snd allows you to specify only the name of the snd resource (e.g.% 'Quack'), not the file. Matlab's READSND and WRITESND only allow you to% specify the filename, not the name of the resource. This is confusing% and inconvenient. One wishes for MEX files, perhaps "SndRead" and% "SndWrite", that would accept both the filename and the snd resource% name. However, the need isn't pressing; you can use ResEdit to copy snd% resources (e.g. from the System file) into individual files (one file% per snd), which you can access with Matlab's READSND and WRITESND% commands. You can get ResEdit from Apple's web site:% web http://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n10964% (Thanks to Gary Marcus for asking.)% % Snd.mex is an enhanced version of our now-obsolete SndPlay.mex, which% was based partly on PlaySound.c by Malcom Slaney, and partly on % VideoToolbox CreateTrialSounds.c.
