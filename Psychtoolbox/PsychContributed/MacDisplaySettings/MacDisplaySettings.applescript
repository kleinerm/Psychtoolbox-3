(*MacDisplaySettings.applescriptDenis G. Pelli, denis.pelli@nyu.eduMay 9, 2020. INTRODUCTIONThis applescript run handler allows you read and set seven parameters ofthe macOS System Preferences Displays panel: Brightness (slider),"Automatically adjust brightness" (checkbox), True Tone (checkbox)(present only on some Macs made in 2018 or later),  Night Shift pop upand checkbox), and Color Profile (by name or row number) and a checkbox"Show Profiles For This Display Only". Apple invites users to use theseparameters to personally customize their experience by enabling dynamicadjustments of all displayed images in response to personal preference,ambient lighting, and time of day. Users seem to like that, but thoseadjustments could defeat our efforts to calibrate the display one dayand, at a later date, use our calibrations to reliably present anaccurately specified stimulus. MacDisplaySettings aims to satisfyeveryone, by allowing your calibration and test programs to use thecomputer in a fixed state, unaffected by user whims, ambient lighting,and time of day, while saving and restoring whatever custom states theusers have customized it to. MacDisplaySettings reports and controlsthese five settings. It allows you to read their current states, setthem to standard values for your critical work, and, when you're done,restore them to their original values.I wrote this script to be invoked from MATLAB, but you could call it from any application running under macOS. To support an external monitoryou must provide the global rect of the external screen; that's not necessary for the main screen.MacDisplaySettings allows you to temporarily override any macOS usercustomization of the display, to allow calibration and user testing withstable display settings. It allows you to peek and poke seven settings inthe System Preferences:Displays panel by using the corresponding fieldsin the oldXXX and newXXX arguments, where XXX is as follows:  DISPLAYbrightness            the Brightness sliderautomatically         the "Automatically adjust brightness" checkbox (true or false)trueTone              the "True Tone" checkbox (true or false)  NIGHT SHIFTnightShiftSchedule    the Night Shift Schedule pop up menu  ('Off','Custom', or 'Sunset to Sunrise')nightShiftManual      the Night Shift Manual checkbox (true or false)  COLORshowProfilesForThisDisplayOnly	the checkbox (true or false)profile               name of selection in Color Profile menu (text)profileRow            row # of selection in Color Profile menu (integer)INPUT ARGS: The screenNumber, if provided, must be an integer of an available  screen, i.e. one of the values returned by Screen('Screens'). If newProfileRow is specified then newProfile is ignored. True Tone is not available on Macs manufactured before 2018.OUTPUT ARGS: The variables oldXXX (where XXX stands for any of the fields listed above) report the prior state of all available parameters. errorMsgis the last output argument. If everything worked then errorMsg is an emptystring. Otherwise it will describe one failure, even if there wereseveral. In peeking, the fields corresponding to parameters that couldnot be read will be empty [], and is not flagged as an error. Any omission in poking is flagged as an error. If you get an error while poking, you might call MacDisplaySettings again to compare the new peek with what you poked.SCREENNUMBER (AND GLOBAL RECT): We endeavor to interpret screenNumber in the same way as Screen (0 for main screen, 1 for first external monitor, etc.). To achieve this werequest the global rect of the desired monitor as 4 input arguments. We anticipate that the rect will be provided by Screen('GlobalRect',screenNumber). We use this rect to select whichever window of System Preferences: Displays is on the desired monitor. This is reliable, provided the userdoes not move those windows to different screens. This applescript code works with whichever Displays window is currently on the desired monitor. (If there areseveral, it will randomly pick one.)BRIGHTNESS is a slider on the Displays panel, allowing users to easilyadjust the "Brightness" of Apple Macintosh liquid crystal displays.Setting this parameter is equivalent to manually opening the SystemPreference:Displays and adjusting the "brightnes" slider.The "brightness" setting controls the luminance of the fluorescent lightthat is behind the liquid crystal display. I believe that this"brightness" setting controls only the luminance of the source, and doesnot affect the liquid crystal display. The screen luminance ispresumably the product of the two factors: luminance of the source andtransmission of the liquid crystal, at each wavelength.AUTOMATICALLY is a checkbox on the Displays panel. WHen enabled themacOS adjusts the display luminance to track ambient lighting. I findthat pleasant as a user, but it's terrible for calibrationg.TRUE TONE checkbox on the Displays panel.NIGHT SHIFT panel has a "Schedule" pop-up menu and a "Manual" checkbox.DISPLAY PROFILE is a menu of named profiles on the "Color" panel.Most of these controls don't interact. However,showProfilesForThisDisplayOnly affects the choices available forselecting a Profile. When you call MacDisplaySettings with a setting forshowProfilesForThisDisplayOnly, that setting is applied before it peeksor pokes the Profile selection.ERROR CHECKING. Most of the controls are straightforward. You are justpeeking and poking a Boolean (0 or 1) or a small integer with a knownrange. Brightness and Profile are more subtle, so MacDisplaySettingsalways checks by peeking immediately after poking Brightness (float) or Profile (whether by name or by row). A discrepancy will be flagged by a string in errorMsg. Note that you provide a float to Brightness but within the macOS it's quantized to roughly 18-bit precision. The peek of Brightness is considered erroneous only if it differes by more than 0.001 from what we poked.SYSTEM PREFERENCES TAKES 30 S TO OPEN: This script uses the "SystemPreferences: Displays" panel, which takes 30 s to launch, if it isn'talready running. We leave it running.All returned values are [] if your application (e.g. MATLAB) does nothave permission to control your computer (see APPLE SECURITY below).In MATLAB, you should call MacDisplaySettings.m, which calls thisapplescript.:oldSettings=MacDisplaySettings(screenNumber,newSettings);To call this applescript directly from MATLAB:[status, errorMsg, oldBrightness, oldAutomatically, oldTrueTone, ...	oldNightSchedule, oldNightShiftManual, oldProfileRow, oldProfile] ...	= ...	system(['osascript MacDisplaySettings.applescript ' ...	num2str(screenNumber) ' '...	num2str(newBrightness) ' ' ...	num2str(newAutomatically) ' '...	num2str(newTrueTone) ' '...	num2str(newNightShiftSchedule) ' ' ...	num2str(ewNightShiftManual) ' '...	num2str(newShowProfilesForThisDisplayOnly) ' '...	num2str(newProfileRow) ' ' ...	'"' newProfile '"']);Calling from any other language is very similar. Ignore the returned "status", which seems to always be zero.COMPATIBILITY: macOS VERSION: Works on Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan,and Mojave (macOS 10.9 to 10.14). Not yet tested on macOS 10.8 orearlier, or on Catalina (10.15). INTERNATIONAL: It is designed (but notyet tested) to work internationally, with macOS localized for anylanguage, not just English. (For example, that is why we select theDisplay/Colors panel by the internal name "displaysDisplayTab" insteadusing the localized name "Display".) MULTIPLE SCREENS: All my computershave only one screen, so I haven't yet tested it with values ofscreenNumber other than zero.FOR SPEED WE LEAVE SYSTEM PREFERENCES OPEN: This script uses the System Preferences app, which takes 30 s to open, if it isn't already open, so we leave it open. 	APPLE SECURITY. Unless the application (e.g. MATLAB) calling this scripthas permission to control the computer, attempts to changes settingswill be blocked. In that case the appropriate Security and PrivacySystem Preference panel is opened and an error dialog window asks theuser to provide the permission. A user with admin privileges should thenclick as requested to provide that permission. This needs to be doneonly once for each application that calls this script. The permission isremembered forever. Once permission has been granted, subsequent callsof this script will work. Note that a user lacking admin access isunable to grant the permission; in that case every time you call thisscript, you'll get the error dialog window.Psychtoolbox Screen.mex. Screen(...

Wrote AutoBrightness to control the "Automatically adjustbrightness" checkbox of the Displays panel.May 29, 2015 Enhanced to allow specification of screenNumber.June 1, 2015. Polished the comments.July 25, 2015 Previously worked on Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9). Nowenhanced to also support Yosemite (Mac OS X 10.10.4).August 3, 2015 Now uses try-blocks to try first group 1 and then group 2to cope with variations in Apple's macOS. I find that under macOS 10.9the checkbox is always in group 1. Under macOS 10.10 I have previouslyfound it in group 2, but now I find it in group 1, so it seems best forthe program to keep trying groups until it finds the checkbox: first 1,then 2, then give up.February 29, 2016 Improved the wording of the pop-up screen to spell outwhat the user needs to do to allow MATLAB to control the computer.June 25, 2017. First version of Brightness, based on my AutoBrightness.applescriptApril 9, 2020. Now called MacDisplaySettings.applescript merging codefrom Brightness and AutoBrightness, and adding code for True Tone andNight Shift.April 14, 2020. Added loops to wait "until exists tab group 1 of windowwindowNumber" before accessing it. This change has enormously increasedthe reliability. I think the old failures were timeouts, and the waitloops seem to have almost entirely fixed that.May 2, 2020. Watching it work, I notice that the operations on theSystem Preferences panel are glacially slow while it's in background, behind MATLAB, but zippy, like a fast human operator, when SystemPreferences is foremost. Observing that, I now "activate" SystemPreferences at the beginning (and reactivate the former app when weexit), and this runs much faster. Formerly delays of 60 s were common.Now it reliably takes 3 s.May 5, 2020. Return an error message if anything went wrong. The userwill know that everything's ok if the error string is empty. Also applythe user's setting of newShowProfilesForThisDisplayOnly before peekingand poking.May 9, 2020. Improved speed (from 3 to 1.6 s) by replacing fixed delaysin applescript with wait loops. Enhanced the built-in peek of brightnessafer poking. Now if the peek differs by more than 0.001,MacDisplaySettings waits 100 ms and tries again, to let the value settle,as the visual effect is a slow fade. Then it reports in errorMsg if thenew peek differs by more than 0.001. In limited testing, waiting for agood answer works: the peek-poke difference rarely exceeds +/-5e-6 andnever exceeds 0.001. It's my impression that if we always waited 100 ms,then the discrepancy would always be less than +/-5e-6.*)on run argv	-- INPUT SETTINGS: screenNumber, newBrightness, newAutomatically, newTrueTone, 	-- newNightShiftSchedule, newNightShiftManual,	-- newShowProfilesForThisDisplayOnly, newProfileRow, newProfile.	-- OUTPUT SETTINGS: olsdBrightness, oldAutomatically, oldTrueTone, oldNightShift,	-- oldShowProfilesForThisDisplayOnly, oldProfileRow, oldProfile.	-- integer screenNumber.
