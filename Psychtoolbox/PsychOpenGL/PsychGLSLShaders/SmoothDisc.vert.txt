/*
 * File: smoothdisc.vert.txt
 * Shader for drawing of basic parameterized smoothed discs.
 *
 * This is the vertex shader. It takes the attributes (parameters)
 * provided by the Screen('DrawTexture(s)') command, performs some
 * basic calculations on it - the calculations that only need to be
 * done once per  patch and that can be reliably carried out
 * at sufficient numeric precision in a vertex shader - then it passes
 * results of computations and other attributes as 'varying' parameters
 * to the fragment shader.
