Functions listed in this file will not have interfaces automatically generated by autocode.m.

(The file is searched using grep, so functions whose names appear anywhere in the file will be skipped.)

- these have character pointer return arguments that should be used to generate MATLAB strings
glGetString			- implemented manually
gluErrorString			- implemented manually
gluGetString			- implemented manually

- these use double indirection, which is rare enough in OpenGL that autocode.m doesn't handle it
glGetBufferPointerv		- implemented manually
glGetPointerv			- implemented manually
glGetVertexAttribPointerv	- implemented manually
glShaderSource          - special interface implemented manually
glMultiDrawElements		- need alternate interface to this function, as it
            			  involves arrays of pointers, whereas we normally don't have
				          access to pointers to a matrix's data in MATLAB
glMultiDrawElementsBaseVertex - ditto.
glCreateShaderProgramv - ditto.
glCompileShaderInclude - We do not implement this one yet.
glCompileShaderIncludeARB - We do not implement this one yet.
glTransformFeedbackVaryings - Arrays of strings - manually implemented.
glTransformFeedbackVaryingsEXT - Arrays of strings - manually implemented.
glTransformFeedbackVaryingsNV - Arrays of strings - manually implemented.

- these use pointers to structs and other impossible to handle stuff
glCreateSyncFromCLeventARB
glGetUniformIndices

- these are part of the ARB_imaging extension, which we will never ever support:
glGetColorTable
glGetColorTableParameteriv
glGetColorTableParameterfv
glGetnColorTableARB
glGetConvolutionFilter
glGetnConvolutionFilterARB
glGetConvolutionParameteriv
glGetConvolutionParameterfv
glGetHistogram
glGetnHistogramARB
glGetHistogramParameteriv
glGetHistogramParameterfv
glGetSeparableFilter
glGetnSeparableFilterARB
glGetMinmax
glGetnMinmaxARB
glGetnPixelMapfvARB
glGetnPixelMapusvARB
glGetnPixelMapuivARB

- these involve C callback functions
gluNurbsCallback
gluNurbsCallbackData
gluNurbsCallbackDataEXT
gluQuadricCallback
gluTessCallback
gluNewTess
gluDeleteTess
gluTessBeginContour
gluTessBeginPolygon
gluTessEndContour
gluTessEndPolygon
gluTessNormal
gluTessProperty
gluTessVertex
gluBeginPolygon
gluEndPolygon
gluNextContour
glDebugMessageCallbackARB
glDebugMessageCallback

- these are not defined yet in the GLEW 1.11.0 library - need to manually implement interface
glSamplePass        - implemented manually

- these need our special malloc(),calloc(),free() buffer management to work on Matlab & Octave:
glFeedbackBuffer    - implemented manually
glSelectBuffer      - implemented manually

- these needed some patches (therefore stored in gl_manual.c) to allow their use with VBOs and PBOs and special pointer magic
