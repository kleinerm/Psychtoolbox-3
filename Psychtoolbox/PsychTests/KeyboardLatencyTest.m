function KeyboardLatencyTest(triggerlevel, modality, submode, portString)
% KeyboardLatencyTest([triggerlevel=0.01][,modality=0][,submode][,portString])
%
% Uses sound capture with high timing precision via
% PsychPortAudio() for measuring latency, timing accuracy and variability
% of various response input devices, e.g., keyboard, keypad, mouse, other
% HID devices like Joysticks etc., various response button boxes, and some
% exotic response devices.
%
% Whenever the script tells you, hit a key on the tested input device
% hard and loud enough so the noise of hitting the button or key can be
% recorded by the attached microphone. This noise will be timestamped by
% the code as the "true" button press time. Timestamps acquired
% by standard input device queries are compared against that reference
% and the difference is computed as device latency.
% 
% Sound is captured from the default recording device, waiting
% until the amplitude exceeds some 'triggerlevel'.
%
% The 'modality' flag chooses between keyboard (==0 - the default), and
% mouse (==1). 'portString' allows to select which keyboard to test on some
% systems (OS/X and Linux). It also allows to select which mouse to test on
% Linux, but not on other systems.
%
% A 'modality' of 2 queries the keyboard, a keypad, a mouse, or other HID
% devices by use of the KbTriggerWait() function. 'submode' specifies the
% KbName() keyCode of the key to test on a keyboard. By default the SPACE
% key is used. For other devices you *must* specify a key or button number in
% 'submode'. Specifiying numbers of non-existent keys or buttons will cause
% an infinite hang of Matlab or Octave, as there is no way to interrupt the
% function or press a non-existent key or button. The optional 'portString'
% specifies the deviceIndex of the device to test. If omitted, the primary
% keyboard is tested.
%
% A 'modality' of 3 will test the PsychRTBox() driver for the USTCRTBOX reaction
% time button box, if such a box is attached. A setting 4 will also test
% that box, but without opening a connection to it, ie., it is assumed that
% the box is already open from a previous call of this function with
% modality setting '3'. This allows to repeat the test many times without
% recalibrating the box. The optional 'submode' flag selects different ways
% of testing the box: A setting of zero will perform a 'ClockRatio'
% calibration to provide exact live timestamps and to test drift
% correction. A setting of 1 will skip this, so live timestamps will
% exhibit clock-drift and only the post-hoc timestamps will be somewhat
% exact. A setting of 2 will skip collection of post-hoc timestamps.
%
% A 'modality' of 5 will exercise the RB-x30 response pads from Cedrus.
%
% A 'modality' of 6 will exercise the PST serial response button box.
% Setting 'submode' to 1 will optimize for use with FTDI serial-USB
% converters.
%
% A 'modality' of 7 will exercise the CMU serial response button box.
% Setting 'submode' to 1 will optimize for use with FTDI serial-USB
% converters.
%
% A 'modality' of 8 will exercise the Bitwhacker emulated response button box.
% Setting 'submode' to 1 will optimize for use with FTDI serial-USB
% converters.
%
% A 'modality' of 9 will exercise the fORP serial response button box in
% program mode 0.
% Setting 'submode' to 1 will optimize for use with FTDI serial-USB
% converters.
%
%
% The optional 'portString' argument can be set to define the serial port
% to connect to for response devices that are connected via serial port.
% By default, the proper serial port is auto-detected, but you can override
% a wrong detection this way.
%
%
% Obviously this method of measuring carries quite a bit of uncertainty
% in exact timing, but with a high quality microphone, proper tuning and
% good sound hardware, it shouldn't be off too much. At least you get a
% rough feeling for the lags inherent to keyboards and mice.
