% PsychPortAudioTimingTest([exactstart=1][, deviceid=-1][, latbias=0][, waitframes=1][, useDPixx=0][, triggerLevel=0.01])
%
% Test script for sound onset timing reliability and sound onset
% latency of the PsychPortAudio sound driver.
%
% This script configures the driver for low latency and high timing
% precision, then executes ten trials where it tries to emit a beep sound,
% starting in exact sync to a black-white transition on the display.
%
% You'll need measurement equipment to use this: A photo-diode attached to
% the top-left corner of your CRT display, a microphone attached to your
% speakers, some oszillograph to record and measure the signals from the
% diode and microphone.
%
% Some parameters may need tweaking. Make sure you got a setup as described
% in 'help InitializePsychSound' for best results.
%
% Optional parameters:
%
% 'exactstart' = 0 -- Start immediately, measure absolute latency.
%              = 1 -- Test accuracy of scheduled sound onset. (Default)
%
% 'deviceid'   = -1 -- Auto-select optimal device (Default).
%             >=0   -- Select specified output device. See
%                      PsychPortAudio('GetDevices') for a list of devices.
%
% 'latbias'    = Hardware inherent latency bias. To be determined by
%                measurement - allows to PA to correct for it if provided.
%                Unit is seconds. Defaults to zero.
%
% 'waitframes' = Time to wait (in video refresh intervals) before emitting beep + flash.
%                Defaults to a value of 1, may need to be set higher for
%                high latency sound hardware (where absolute latency > 1
%                video refresh duration).
%
% 'useDPixx'   = 1 -- Use DataPixx device to automatically measure the true
%                     audio onset time wrt. to visual stimulus onset.
%                0 -- Don't use DataPixx. This is the default.
%
% 'triggerLevel' = Sound signal amplitude for DataPixx to detect sound
%                  onset. Defaults to 0.01 = 1% of max amplitude if
%                  exactstart == 0, otherwise it is auto-detected by
%                  calibration. This will likely need tweaking on your
%                  setup. If the measured audio onset delta by DataPixx is
%                  much lower (or almost zero) than the expected delta
%                  reported by PsychPortAudio, then the triggerLevel may be
%                  too low and you should try if slightly higher thresholds
%                  help to discriminate signal from noise. Too high values
%                  may cause a hang of the script. In practice, levels
%                  between 0.01 and 0.1 should yield good results. Setting
%                  the 'useDPixx' flag to 2 also plots the waveforms
%                  captured by DataPixx, which may help in selection of the
%                  optimal triggerLevel.
