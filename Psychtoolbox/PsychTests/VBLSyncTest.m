%
% Tests syncing of PTB-OSX to the vertical retrace (VBL) and demonstrates
% how to implement the old Screen('WaitBlanking') behaviour with
% Screen('Flip')...
%
% This script provides a means to test, how well PTB on OS-X synchronizes
% stimulus onset and execution of Matlab with the vertical retrace
% (also known as vertical blank or VBL) on your specific hardware setup.
%
% The script first opens a double-buffered fullscreen window. Then it
% performs a monitor calibration timing loop to estimate the real monitor refresh
% interval (aka IFI): While the formula ifi = 1.0 / Screen('NominalFramerate') will
% return an ifi that is close to the real IFI, it will be a little bit off
% from the real value. The reason is unavoidable jitter in the manufacturing of
% graphics cards internal clock circuits, as well as some drift and jitter
% caused by instabilities and change in the power supply and operating
% temperature of your machine. To be on the safe side, we use a timing-loop
% to compute the real IFI as an average of the IFI's of a number of consecutive
% monitor refresh intervals.
%
% After the calibration you'll see a simple animation: A flashing rectangle
% moving from the top-left corner of the screen to the bottom-right corner.
% During this animation, which lasts 'n' frames, it collects information
% about the timing behaviour.
%
% At the end, a couple of graphs are shown to you that should allow you to
% assess the timing behaviour of your setup.
%
% The following parameters can be changed in order to simulate different
% loads and stimulus presentation timings to assess PTB's behaviour under
% different conditions.
%
%
% PARAMETERS:
%
% n = Number of samples to take. E.g., n=1000 == Draw an animation
% consisting of 1000 frames.
%
%
%
% numifis = Number of monitor refresh intervals (IFIs) between flips:
% 0 == Flip at each vertical retrace: This is the old PTB 1.0.50 behaviour.
% Values of numifis>0 will cause Screen('Flip') to wait for 'numifis'
% monitor refresh intervals before flipping the back- and front buffers in
% sync with the vertical retrace.
%
% This would be roughly equivalent to the following snippet of code in the old
% MacOS9-PTB:
% ...
% Screen('WaitBlanking', windowPtr, numifis);
% Screen('CopyWindow', windowPtr, myOffscreenWindowwithStimulusPtr);
% ...
%
%
%
% loadjitter = Simulated load with a random duration between 0 ms
% and loadjitter monitor refresh intervals: We wait for the specified
% amount of time to simulate the execution of other Matlab-code, e.g.,
% KbChecks, GetMouse, Matlab calculations ...
%
%
%
% clearmode = Change the behaviour of Flip after flipping.
% clearmode = 0 will clear your stimulus drawing surface to background color after flip.
% This is the behaviour as found in PTB 1.0.50. After Flip you start with an
% empty image and can draw a completely new stim.
% 
% clearmode = 1 will not clear after a flip, but keep the contents of your stimulus
% image after the Flip: This allows you to incrementally update/draw stimuli.
%
% clearmode = 2 will neither clear nor keep the drawing surface after Flip, but leave the
% cleanup work to you. To be precise: The drawing surface will contain the
% stimulus image that was *just shown* on the screen. Think of Flip as if it would
% flip the front- and back-side of a sheet of paper: The current front side
% shows the stim to your subject, the current back side is where you draw.
% clearmode 2 will allow you to update the back side, which was the front
% side before the flip happened! This mode is useful if you want to save
% about 0.5-2 ms of time needed for mode 1 or 2 if you draw stimuli on very
% tight deadlines. 
%
%
% stereo = Test timing of display of stereoscopic stimuli.
% stereo = 0 will show you a standard monoscopic display.
% stereo = 1 will use the OS-X stereo output facilities to show stereoscopic
% stimuli: OS-X will quickly alternate between two images at each monitor refresh,
% one for the left-eye, one for the right-eye, while generating proper
% control signals for LCD shutter glasses. This should work with MacOS-X
% compatible stereo display hardware, e.g., CrystalEyes shutter glasses.
%
%
% flushpipe = Mark end of drawing commands to improve presentation timing.
% PTB knows a new command Screen('DrawingFinished') which, when properly used,
% will give PTB hints on how to optimize drawing of stimuli: This allows to draw
% more complex stimuli at higher monitor refesh intervals with reliable presentation
% timing. flushpipe enables/disables use of this new command.
%
% flushpipe = 0 Don't mark end of drawing commands.
% flushpipe = 1 Mark end of drawing commands to improve timing.
%
%
% synchronous = 0 Don't wait for drawing completion in Screen('DrawingFinished')
% synchronous = 1 Wait for completion - Useful for benchmarking and debugging,
% but degrades performance significantly in real experiments.
%
%
% usedpixx = 1 Use a DataPixx/ViewPixx/ProPixx device for external
% timestamping of stimulus onset, as a correctness test for Screen('Flip')
% timestamping. Disabled (0) by default.
% usedpixx = 2 Additionally correct for the clock skew between the computer
% and DataPixx device.
%
%
% screenNumber =  Use a screen other than the default (max) for testing .
%
%
% EXAMPLES:
%
% VBLSyncTest(1000, 0, 0.6, 0, 0, 1, 0) -- Render 1000 consecutive frames,
% flip at each retrace , pausing for 0.6 frame durations after each flip.
% Clear the framebuffer after flip, don't use stereo output, but use the new
% "DrawingFinished" command.
%
% VBLSyncTest(100, 10, 6, 1, 0, 1, 0) -- Render 100 frames,
% flip only every 10th monitor refresh interval ("WaitBlanking" for 10 refresh intervals),
% pause for 6 frame durations after each flip. Don't clear the framebuffer after
% flip, don't use stereo output, but use the new "DrawingFinished" command.
%
% VBLSyncTest(100, 10, 6, 1, 1, 1, 0) -- Render 100 frames,
% flip only every 10th monitor refresh interval ("WaitBlanking" for 10 refresh intervals),
% pause for 6 frame durations after each flip. Don't clear the framebuffer after
% flip, use stereo output via "frame-sequential stereo", use the new "DrawingFinished" command.
%
%
%
% THE PLOTS:
%
% Explanation of how to read the plots:
%
% Figure 1 shows the time delta between start of the VBL of successive
% Flip's: This value should be close to the requested delta as specified to
% Flip, e.g., you set numifis=0 or numifis=1 on a 100 Hz monitor. Then
% delta should be close to 1000 ms / 100 Hz = 10 ms. If numifis=2, it
% should be close to two monitor refresh intervals = 20 ms...
% 
% The green horizontal line denotes the proper delta value for your monitor
% refresh rate and 'numifis' value. The blue graph shows measured deltas. A
% jitter of less than +/- 1 ms indicates proper stimulus presentation timing -
% no skipped frames.
%
%
% Figure 2 shows the rasterbeam positions when flip took its internal
% timestamp: The values should be usually above the screen height, e.g., on
% a monitor resolution of 1200 x 1024 pixels, values should be above 1024.
% Values way below 1024 are also ok (e.g., < 100). This just means that
% your computer is either pretty slow, or connected to a flat-panel.
% Lots of randomly distributed values between 0 and 1024 would indicate sync trouble.
%
%
% Figure 3: Shows the estimated difference between requested presentation
% deadline and the real presentation deadline (start of VBL). Positive
% values indicate a deadline-miss and give you an indication of how much
% the deadline has been missed. Negative (or zero) values indicate that the
% deadline has been met. While the sign of this value is useful for assessing
% timing, the value itself is only meaningful for people who can read and
% fully understand the C source code and logic of 'Flips' implementation...
%
% Figure 4: Shows the difference (in milliseconds) between estimated
% start of VBL and return of the Flip command to Matlab. This is some
% indication of the processing overhead of OpenGL, the Operating system and
% Psychtoolbox when executing 'Flip'. It's also a lower bound for the
% timing delay when trying to synchronize start of acquisition devices to
% VBL.
%
% Figure 5: Shows the difference (in milliseconds) between estimated
% stimulus onset (aka end of vertical retrace, scanning beam starts
% at top of screen) and the end of Flip. This is the crucial value, if you
% want to sync something like sound-playback, triggering of some
% data-acquisition device (fMRI, MEG, EEG, ...) to stimulus onset. It
% should give you a feeling of how well you can sync. It's possible that
% negative values are reported on fast machines - Flip returns ahead of
% time (while monitor is still in retrace state). This is fine because your
% Matlab-Code for triggering something will add additional delays... Values
% should be below 1-2 milliseconds on reasonably modern and correctly
% configured hardware.
%
% Figure 6: Is only displayed when flag 'synchronous=1' This figure shows
% the total accumulated time for all drawing commands from the last Flip to the
% DrawingFinished command. It allows you to get a feeling on how hard the
% graphics hardware has to work for drawing your stim - and if it is
% possible at all to draw the stim on your hardware, given your time
% constraints. During a normal experiment (without sync-flag), the
% execution times of your Matlab code (as measured, e.g., by tic and toc)
% and of the drawing commands don't add up, because the graphics hardware
% works in parallel to the Matlab code.
%
%
% Please read the code of this M-File carefully as an example of how to get
% the best possible presentation timing on PTB-OSX.
