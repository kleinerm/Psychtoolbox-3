function DownloadPsychtoolbox(targetdirectory, flavor, targetRevision)
% DownloadPsychtoolbox([targetdirectory][, flavor][, targetRevision])
%
% This script downloads the latest GNU/Linux, Mac OSX, or MS-Windows
% Psychtoolbox-3, version 3.0.10 or later, from our git-server to your
% disk, creating your working copy, ready to use as a new toolbox in your
% MATLAB/OCTAVE application. Subject to your permission, any old
% installation of the Psychtoolbox is first removed. It's a careful
% program, checking for all required resources and privileges before it
% starts.
%
% Note: If you use a Debian derived Linux distribution, e.g., Debian or
% Ubuntu, consider installing the package octave-psychtoolbox-3 or
% matlab-psychtoolbox-3 instead from http://neuro.debian.net - This is more
% convenient and will provide you with automatic updates.
%
% CAUTION: Psychtoolbox 3.0.13 will not work anymore with 32-Bit Octave-4
% on MS-Windows, or with OSX versions earlier than 10.10 "Yosemite".
% Psychtoolbox will likely work with versions of Microsoft Windows older
% than Windows-10, but it is not tested on such systems anymore and not
% supported at all on Windows versions earlier than Windows-7. For best
% compatibility you should probably use Windows-10 with all upgrades
% installed.
%
% CAUTION: Psychtoolbox 3.0.12 will not work anymore with 32-Bit Matlab, or
% with OSX versions earlier than 10.8 "Mountain Lion". Psychtoolbox may
% work with versions of Microsoft Windows older than Windows-7, but it is
% not tested or supported on such ancient Windows systems anymore, so use
% at your own risk.
%
% Psychtoolbox 3.0.11 *will not work* with GNU/Octave on MS-Windows, or
% with 32-Bit Octave on OSX, as support for these setups has been cancelled
% for the 3.0.10 series. It will also not work with 32-Bit Matlab on OSX,
% or with OSX versions earlier than 10.6.8 "Snow Leopard", unless you
% choose the unsupported legacy flavor "Psychtoolbox-3.0.10" via the
% optional 'flavor' parameter.
%
% If you want to download older versions of Psychtoolbox than 3.0.10, e.g.,
% version 3.0.9, use the DownloadLegacyPsychtoolbox() function instead of
% this function.
%
% On Mac OSX, all parameters are optional. On MS-Windows and GNU/Linux, the
% first parameter "targetdirectory" with the path to the installation
% target directory is required. The "targetdirectory" name may not contain
% any white space, otherwise download will fail with mysterious error
% messages!
% 
% On OSX, your working copy of the Psychtoolbox will be placed in either
% your /Applications or your /Users/Shared folder (depending on permissions
% and your preference), or you may specify a 'targetdirectory', as you
% prefer.
%
% On Microsoft Windows, you must specify the full path, including
% the drive name where Psychtoolbox should be installed, e.g.,
% 'C:\MyToolboxes\'.
%
% The desired flavor of a Psychtoolbox release can be selected via the
% optional "flavor" parameter: By default, 'beta' (aka 'current') will be
% installed if you don't specify otherwise, as this is almost always the
% best possible choice. You may be able to download an old versioned
% release via a namestring like 'Psychtoolbox-x.y.z', e.g.,
% 'Psychtoolbox-3.0.7' if you'd want to download version 3.0.7. This is
% only useful if you run a very old operating system or Matlab version that
% isn't supported by the current "beta" anymore, so you'd need to stick
% with an old versioned release.
%
% Normally your download should just work(TM). Very infrequently, the
% download servers may be overloaded or down for maintenance, resulting in
% download failure. In that case, please retry a few hours later.
%
%
% The "targetRevision" argument is optional and should be normally omitted.
% Normal behaviour is to download the latest revision of Psychtoolbox. If
% you provide a specific targetRevision, then this script will install a
% copy of Psychtoolbox according to the specified revision.
%
% This is only useful if you experience problems and want to revert to an
% earlier known-to-be-good release.
%
% Revisions can be specified by a revision number or by the special flag
% 'PREV' which will choose the revision before the most current one.
%
%
% INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: The Wiki contains much more up to date
% instructions. If in doubt, follow instructions on the Wiki!
%
% 1. If you don't already have it, you must install the Subversion client.
% For Mac OSX 10.6 and later, download the latest Mac OSX Subversion client
% from: http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/download#osx
% If you have the XCode command line tools installed, you won't need to
% install subversion as it is included in these tools.
% 
% For Windows, download the Windows Subversion client from one of these:
%
% http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows
% http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/download#windows
%
% Install the Subversion client on your machine by double-clicking the
% installer and following the instructions. After installation of the
% Subversion client, you will need to exit and restart Matlab or Octave, so
% it can find the new subversion executable. In many cases it may be
% neccessary to even reboot your computer after installation of subversion.
% Btw. you should avoid to install the client into a path that contains
% blanks/spaces/white-space as this can lead to download failures in some
% cases, e.g., 'C:\Program Files\...' may be bad because there is a blank
% between the "Program" and "Files".
%
% Alternatively, if you don't have the neccessary permissions to install
% Subversion into a system folder, you can install Subversion into an
% arbitrary folder on your system (excluding ones with blanks in their
% path) and then add that folder to your Matlab or Octave path. E.g. you
% installed into D:\MyOwnFolder\Subversion\ . Then you can do this:
% addpath('D:\MyOwnFolder\Subversion\'). Our installer should find the
% client then.
%
% For Linux, just install the subversion package from your package
% management tool.
%
%
% 2. On MacOS/X, to install the Psychtoolbox in the default location
% (/Applications or, failing that, /Users/Shared). Just type:
%
% DownloadPsychtoolbox
%
% Our standard option is in the Applications folder, but note that, as with
% installation of any software, you'll need administrator privileges. Also
% note that if you put the toolbox in the Applications folder, you'll need
% to reinstall it when MATLAB / OCTAVE is updated on your machine. If you
% must install without access to an administrator, we offer the option of
% installing into the /Users/Shared/ folder instead. If you must install
% the Psychtoolbox in some other folder, then specify it in the optional
% first argument of your call.
%
% On Windows or Linux, provide a pathname, e.g.:
% DownloadPsychtoolbox('C:\MyToolboxes\');
%
% That's it. Any pre-existing installation of the Psychtoolbox will be
% removed (if you approve). The program will then download the latest
% Psychtoolbox and update your MATLAB / OCTAVE path and other relevant
% system settings.
%
% Enjoy! If you're new to this, you might start by typing "help
% Psychtoolbox".
%
% P.S. If you get stuck, first check the FAQ section and Download section
% of our Wiki at http://www.psychtoolbox.org. If that doesn't help, post
% your question to the forum by email or web:
%
% web mailto:psychtoolbox@yahoogroups.com
% web http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/messages/
% web http://groups.yahoo.com/group/psychtoolbox/post/
%
% Please specify your full name and the version of your operating system,
% MATLAB / OCTAVE, and psychtoolbox.
%
% UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS:
%
% To upgrade your copy of Psychtoolbox, at any time, to incorporate the
% latest bug fixes, enhancements, and new features, just type:
% UpdatePsychtoolbox
% 
% UpdatePsychtoolbox cannot change the flavor of your Psychtoolbox. To
% change the flavor, run DownloadPsychtoolbox to completely discard your
% old installation and get a fresh copy with the requested flavor.
% 
% PERMISSIONS:
%
% There's a thorny issue with permissions on OS/X. It may not be possible
% to install into /Applications (or whatever the targetdirectory is) with
% the user's existing privileges. The normal situation on Mac OSX is that a
% few users have "administrator" privileges, and many don't. By default,
% writing to the /Applications folder requires administrator privileges.
%
% DownloadPsychtoolbox creates the Psychtoolbox folder with permissions set
% to allow writing by everyone. Our hope is that this will allow updating
% (by UpdatePsychtoolbox) without need for administrator privileges.
%
% Some labs that may want to be able to install without access to an
% administrator. For them we offer the fall back of installing Psychtoolbox
% in /Users/Shared/, instead of /Applications/, because, by default,
% /Users/Shared/ is writeable by all users.
%
% SAVEPATH
%
% Normally all users of MATLAB / OCTAVE use the same path. This path is
% normally saved in MATLABROOT/toolbox/local/pathdef.m, where "MATLABROOT"
% stands for the result returned by running that function in MATLAB, e.g.
% '/Applications/MATLAB.app/Contents/Matlab14.1'. Since pathdef.m is inside
% the MATLAB package, which is normally in the Applications folder,
% ordinary users (not administrators) cannot write to pathdef.m. They'll
% get an error message whenever they try to save the path, e.g. by typing
% "savepath". Most users will find this an unacceptable limitation. The
% solution is very simple, ask an administrator to use File Get Info to set
% the pathdef.m file permissions to allow write by everyone. This needs to
% be done only once, after installing MATLAB.

% History:
%
% 11/02/05 mk  Created.
% 11/25/05 mk  Bug fix for 'targetdirectory' provided by David Fencsik.
% 01/13/06 mk  Added support for download of Windows OpenGL-PTB.
% 03/10/06 dgp Expanded the help text, above, incorporating suggestions
%              from Daniel Shima.
% 03/11/06 dgp Check OS. Remove old Psychtoolbox from path and from disk.
%              After downloading, add new Psychtoolbox to path.
% 03/12/06 dgp Polished error message regarding missing svn.
% 03/13/06 dgp Changed default targetdirectory from PWD to ~/Documents/.
% 03/14/06 dgp Changed default targetdirectory to /Applications/, and
%              if not sufficiently privileged, then /Users/Shared/.
%              Check privilege to create folder. Check SAVEPATH.
% 06/05/06 mk  On Windows, we require the user to pass the full path to
%              the installation folder, because there is no well-defined
%              equivalent to the Mac OS X /Applications/ folder. Also, the order
%              of operations was changed to maximize the chance of getting a
%              working PTB installation despite minor failures of commands
%              like savepath, or fileattrib. We allow the user to decide
%              whether to delete her old Psychtoolbox folders or to
%              retain multiple copies of Psychtoolbox (e.g., beta and stable)
%              so each user can choose between Beta and Stable.
%              We no longer copy UpdatePsychtoolbox.m, since it's included in the 
%              new Psychtoolbox folder 
% 06/06/06 dgp Cosmetic editing of comments, above.
% 06/27/06 dgp Cosmetic editing of comments and messages. Check for spaces
%              in targetdirectory name.
% 9/23/06  mk  Add clear mex call to flush mex files before downloading.
% 10/5/06  mk  Add detection code for MacOS-X on Intel Macs.
% 10/28/06 dhb Allow 'current' as a synonym for 'beta'.
% 11/21/06 mk  Allow alternate install location for svn client: Installer
%              will find the svn executable if its installation folder is
%              included in the Matlab path.
% 02/17/07 mk  Convert flavor spec to lower case in case it isn't.
% 03/15/07 mk  Detection code for Windows 64 bit added.
% 07/18/07 mk  Changed default for flavor from 'stable' to 'beta'.
% 09/27/07 mk  Add another fallback path: Download via https protocol to
%              maybe bypass proxy-servers.
% 10/29/07 mk  Small fix for Kerstin Preuschoffs bugreport: Download of old
%              versions didn't work anymore, becuase 'flavor' string was
%              lower-cased.
% 11/17/07 mk  Prioritized https:// checkout over http:// checkout --> More
%              likely to bypass proxy servers and succeed.
% 12/25/07 mk  Add check for white spaces in path to subversion client - Output warning, if so.
% 12/25/07 mk  Add optional 'downloadmethod' parameter, which allows to
%              select initial choie of download protocol to use, in order to allow to
%              bypass misconfigured proxies and firewalls. Problem reported
%              by Patrick Mineault.
% 01/08/08 mk  On OS/X, add an additional search path for 'svn': /usr/bin/
%              as per suggestion of Donald Kalar. Presumably, Apples Leopard ships
%              with a svn client preinstalled in that location.
%
% 05/07/08 mk  Add better handling of default values. Add 'targetRevision'
%              parameter as option, just as in UpdatePsychtoolbox.m
%
% 06/16/08 mk  Change default initial download protcol from svn: to https:,
%              as Berlios seems to have disabled svnserve protocol :-(
%
% 10/01/08 mk  Add interactive output/query for svn client on the Unices.
%              This to work-around questions of the client about accepting
%              security certificates...
% 01/05/09 mk  Remove && or || to make old Matlab versions happier.
% 01/05/09 mk  Remove && or || to make old Matlab versions happier.
% 01/05/09 mk  Change order of call arguments to make choice of default
%              'beta' flavor more convenient and choice of 'stable'
%              inconvenient. Also add some additional warning text and
%              dialog to tell user how bad 'stable' is and to give him a
%              chance to reconsider.
% 03/22/09 mk  Update help text again. Rename 'stable' into 'unsupported'.
% 05/31/09 mk  Add support for Octave-3.
% 10/05/09 mk  Strip trailing fileseperator from targetDirectory, as
%              suggested by Erik Flister to avoid trouble with new svn
%              clients.
% 12/27/10 mk  Redirect 'beta' downloads on Matlab versions < 6.5 to the
%              special "Psychtoolbox-3.0.8-PreMatlab6.5" compatibility
%              version - The last one to support pre 6.5 Matlab's.
%
% 10/31/11 mk  Change location of SVN repository to
%              http://psychtoolbox-3.googlecode.com/svn/
%              our new home, now that Berlios is shutting down.
%
% 05/27/12 mk  - Strip backwards compatibility support to Matlab pre-R2007a.
%              - Remove PowerPC support.
%              - Strip support for 'stable' / 'unsupported' flavors et al.
%              - Change location of SVN repository to our SVN frontend for GIT:
%                https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3
%
% 05/28/12 mk  Fix disasterous bug: Answering anything but 'y' to the
%              question if old PTB folder should be deleted, caused
%              *deletion* of the folder! Oh dear! This bug present since
%              late 2011.
%
% 09/14/12 mk  Drop support for Octave on MS-Windows.
% 09/14/12 mk  Drop support for 32-Bit Octave on OSX.
% 03/10/13 mk  Add additional svn search-pathes matching UpdatePsychtoolbox et al.
%              Also update download URL for OSX Suversion client.
% 07/02/13 mk  Drop support for 32-Bit Matlab on OSX, and thereby for 32-Bit OSX.
% 07/02/13 mk  Reenable write access for all to Psychtoolbox folder.
% 07/23/13 mk  Do not prevent execution on 32-Bit Matlab on OSX!
% 05/18/14 mk  No support for 32-Bit Matlab on Linux and Windows anymore for 3.0.12.
%              Clarify there's also no support for < OSX 10.8 anymore.
% 10/04/15 mk  Compatibility fixes for Octave-4, cosmetic cleanups.
% 10/28/15 mk  32-Bit Octave-4 support for MS-Windows reestablished.
% 04/01/16 mk  64-Bit Octave-4 support for MS-Windows established.
% 06/01/16 mk  32-Bit Octave-4 support for MS-Windows removed.
% 11/16/16 mk  Don't bail if a specific 'flavor' is requested, otherwise people
%              can not actually download older PTB versions with this downloader.
