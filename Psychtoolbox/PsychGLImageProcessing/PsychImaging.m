function [rc, winRect] = PsychImaging(cmd, varargin)
% rc = PsychImaging(subcommand [,arg1][,arg2][....,argn]) - Control common
% functions of the Psychtoolbox GPU image processing pipeline.
%
% This function allows you to setup and control various aspects and common
% functions of the Psychtoolbox image processing pipeline in a simple way.
% Various standard scenarious can be conveniently set up with this routine,
% e.g., geometric transformations of your stimulus image, various types of
% display correction, ...
%
% If you want to perform less common, unusual or simply not yet supported tasks
% with the pipeline, use the low-level Screen('HookFunction', ...)
% interface instead and have a peek in the M-File code for the
% PsychImaging.m file to learn about the low-level interface.
% See "help PsychGLImageprocessing" for more info.
%
%
% Subcommands and their meaning:
%
% PsychImaging('PrepareConfiguration');
% - Prepare setup of imaging pipeline for onscreen window.
% This is the first step in the sequence of configuration steps.
%
%
% PsychImaging('AddTask', whichChannel, whichTask [,param1]...);
% - Add a specific task or processing requirement to the list of actions
% to be performed by the pipeline for the currently selected onscreen
% window. 'whichChannel' is a string with the name of the channel to
% configure:
%
% 'LeftView' applies the action to the processing channel
% for the left-eye view of a stereo configuration. 'RightView' applies the
% action to the right-eye view of a stereo configuration. 'AllViews' applies
% the action to both, left- and right eye view channels of a stereo
% configuration or to the single monoscopic channel of a mono display
% configuration. Other options are 'Compositor', 'FinalFormatting' and
% 'Finalizer' for special purpose channels. Set this to 'General' if the
% command doesn't apply to a specific view, but is a general requirement.
%
% 'whichTask' contains the name string of one of the supported
% actions:
%
% * 'UseGPGPUCompute' Enable use of GeneralPurposeGPU computing support.
%   This prepares use of Psychtoolbox functions which are meant to
%   interface with, or take advantage of, the general purpose computation
%   capabilities of modern graphics processing units and other massively
%   parallel compute acceleration hardware, e.g., DSP's, or multi-core
%   processors. Interfacing with such hardware is done via common standard
%   compute API's like NVidia's CUDA or the cross-platform OpenCL API.
%
%   Use of this function often requires specific modern GPU hardware and
%   the installation of additional driver software, e.g., NVidia's freely
%   available CUDA SDK and runtime, or the free and open-source GPUmat
%   toolbox. Read 'help PsychGPGPU' for further info.
%
%   This function just detects and selects supported GPU compute API's for
%   use with Psychtoolbox and initializes them and some Psychtoolbox
%   function to take advantage if appropriate. While you could use those
%   API's by themselves without calling this init function, Psychtoolbox
%   builtin processing functions would not be able to take advantage of the
%   API's or perform efficient and fast data exchange with them.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UseGPGPUCompute', apitype [, flags]);
%
%   'apitype' Allows selection of the compute API to use. The value 'Auto'
%   leaves the choice to Psychtoolbox. The value 'GPUmat' selects the
%   high-level, free and open-source GPUmat compute toolkit for Matlab.
%   Currently no other choices are supported, but this is expected to
%   change in the future.
%
%   'flags' An optional string of keyword flags to determine behaviour.
%   There aren't any flags defined yet.
%
%
% * 'SideBySideCompressedStereo' Ask for stereo display in a horizontally
%   compressed side-by-side format. Left and Right eye images are drawn at
%   full framebuffer resolution by usercode. Screen('Flip', ...) draws them
%   horizontally compressed side-by-side to each other. They are scanned
%   out to the display device this way and then the display device itself
%   uncompresses them back to full resolution and displays them
%   stereoscopically, typically via built-in alternating frame-sequential
%   stereo with stereo goggles, but other methods are conceivable. This is
%   one popular stereo frame packing format for stereo on HDMI display
%   devices. Once you've set up a stereo display mode via PsychImaging, you
%   can tweak its specific parameters by calling the function
%   SetCompressedStereoSideBySideParameters().
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'SideBySideCompressedStereo');
%
%
% * 'InterleavedColumnStereo' Ask for stereo display in interleaved mode.
%   The output image is composed from the lefteye and righteye stereo
%   buffers by interleaving their content: Even columns are filled with
%   content from the left buffer, odd columns are filled with content from
%   the right buffer, i.e., Col 0 = Left col 0, Col 1 = Right Col 0, Col 2
%   = Left col 1, Col 3 = Right col 1, ....
%
%   This mode is useful for driving some auto-stereoscopic displays. These
%   use either some vertical parallax barriers or vertical lenticular
%   lense sheets. These direct light from even columns to one eye, light
%   from odd columns to the other eye.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'InterleavedColumnStereo', startright);
%
%   If 'startright' is zero, then even columns are taken from left buffer. If
%   'startright' is one, then even columns are taken from the right buffer.
%
%   You can use the RemapMouse() function to correct GetMouse() positions
%   for potential geometric distortions introduced by this function.
%
%
% * 'InterleavedLineStereo' Ask for stereo display in interleaved mode.
%   The output image is composed from the lefteye and righteye stereo
%   buffers by interleaving their content: Even lines are filled with
%   content from the left buffer, odd lines are filled with content from
%   the right buffer, i.e., Row 0 = Left row 0, Row 1 = Right row 0, Row 2
%   = Left row 1, Row 3 = Right row 1, ....
%
%   This mode is useful for driving some types of stereo devices and
%   goggles, e.g., the iGlasses 3D Video goggles in interleaved stereo
%   mode.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'InterleavedLineStereo', startright);
%
%   If 'startright' is zero, then even lines are taken from left buffer. If
%   'startright' is one, then even lines are taken from the right buffer.
%
%   You can use the RemapMouse() function to correct GetMouse() positions
%   for potential geometric distortions introduced by this function.%
%
%
% * 'DualWindowStereo' Ask for stereo display in dual-window mode (stereomode 10)
%
%   Only use this function under MacOSX. If possible on your setup and OS,
%   rather use a single window, spanning both stereo display outputs, and use
%   stereomode 4 or 5 to display dual-display stereo. That is much more
%   efficient in terms of speed, computational load and memory consumption,
%   also potentially more robust with respect to visual stimulation timing.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'DualWindowStereo', rightEyeScreen [, rightEyeWindowRect]);
%
%   The left-eye image will be displayed on the screen and at a location
%   specified as usual via PsychImaging('Openwindow', screenid, ..., rect);
%   The right eye image will be displayed on screen 'rightEyeScreen'. If
%   the optional 'rightEyeWindowRect' is specified, then the right eye image
%   is not displayed in a fullscreen window, but in a window with the bounding
%   rectangle 'rightEyeWindowRect'.
%
%
% * 'UseVirtualFramebuffer' Ask for support of virtual framebuffer, even if
%   it isn't strictly needed, given the remaining set of requirements. Most
%   of the tasks require such a framebuffer - it gets enabled anyway. In a
%   few cases, e.g., to simplify your code (no need for special cases), it
%   may be useful to activate such a framebuffer even if it isn't strictly
%   needed. This option activates a minimal buffer with 8 bits per color
%   cmponent fixed point precision.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UseVirtualFramebuffer');
%
%
% * 'UseRetinaResolution' Ask to prefer a framebuffer with the full native
%   resolution of attached HiDPI "Retina" displays on OSX, instead of a scaled
%   down lower resolution framebuffer with typically half the horizontal
%   and vertical resolution of the Retina display. This setting will be
%   ignored if the onscreen window is not displayed on a HiDPI "Retina"
%   display in a scaled display mode, or if the panel fitter is in use by
%   specifying the 'UsePanelFitter' task. By default, Screen() would use a
%   downscaled framebuffer on a Retina display under OSX and scale that low
%   resolution buffer up to full display panel resolution, just as Apples
%   OSX operating system does it by default. This in order to reduce
%   computational load, improve graphics performance, and avoid problems
%   with backward compatibility of old code. If you want to make full use
%   of the resolution of your HiDPI display, specify this task to tell
%   Screen() to use the full display panel resolution on OSX, even if this may
%   introduce some compatibility issues into your code and causes a decrease
%   in graphics performance due to the higher graphics rendering load.
%
%   If 'UseRetinaResolution' is used with a non-fullscreen window, ie.
%   the 'rect' parameter in PsychImaging('OpenWindow', ...) is provided
%   to specify the screen position and size of the window, note that
%   the size of the window rect returned by Screen('GlobalRect') and
%   Screen('Rect'), as well as of the returned rect of PsychImaging('OpenWindow')
%   will differ from the size of the 'rect' passed to 'OpenWindow'. 'rect's
%   passed into OpenWindow for positioning and sizing the window, as well
%   as the global position rect returned by Screen('GlobalRect') for the
%   current size and position of the onscreen window are expressed in global
%   desktop coordinates, in somewhat arbitrary units of virtual "points".
%   How such a point translates into display pixels depends on the operating
%   system, possibly the desktop GUI in use (on other systems than OSX), the
%   set of connected displays and their Retina or non-Retina resolutions.
%   The aim is that the coordinate system is somewhat consistent and meaningful
%   across all connected displays, for varying definitions of "consistent" and
%   "meaningful" on different operating systems, but the mapping of points to
%   physical screen pixels can be different on each connected display, at the
%   discretion of the operating system. You may get especially "interesting"
%   results if you try to move an onscreen window between screens, or let it
%   span multiple displays of different type and resolution.
%   The rect returned by PsychImaging('Openwindow') and Screen('Rect'), as
%   well as sizes returned by Screen('WindowSize') define the net useable
%   size of the window in display pixels. It is affected by all kind of
%   PsychImaging operations, e.g., selection of stereo modes, high bit depth
%   modes etc., but also by scaling on Retina displays in high res mode.
%   If 'UseRetinaResolution' is used on a Retina/HiDPI display, one typical
%   result will be that the size of the window in pixels reported by these
%   functions will be higher than the size in points, as one virtual point will
%   get represented by more than 1 pixel on a Retina display. Observing twice
%   the window size in pixels than in points is quite typical, but other
%   scaling factors are possible. The take home message for you is to specify
%   location and size of your stimuli based on the sizes and rects returned
%   by Screen('Rect'), PsychImaging('Openwindow') and Screen('Windowsize'), as
%   these are in units of display pixels, and *not* based on the virtual points
%   returned by Screen('GlobalRect'). The 2nd take home message is that you
%   should mostly use fullscreen windows for visual stimulation to avoid such
%   and other pitfalls.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UseRetinaResolution');
%
%
% * 'UseDisplayRotation' Ask to use builtin panel fitter exclusively for
%   rotating the framebuffer. This is useful if you want to turn your
%   display device from landscape (= normal upright) orientation into
%   portrait orientation (= rotated by 90 degrees clockwise or
%   counterclockwise). In such a case you will want to rotate the
%   framebuffer by 90 degrees as well, but you should *not* use the "rotate
%   monitor" function of your operating system for this purpose, as this
%   will very likely interfere with visual stimulus presentation timing and
%   timestamping! Use this task instead. It will perform rotation in a
%   similar way, but without severe interference to timing. However, there
%   is one limitation to this method: Multisample anti-aliasing currently
%   does not work if you use our framebuffer rotation.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UseDisplayRotation', angle);
%
%   'angle' is the desired rotation angle. The only values which will give
%   well defined and useful results are multiples of 90 degrees, useful
%   values are essentially 0, +90, -90 and 180 degrees for no rotation,
%   clockwise rotation, counterclockwise rotation and upside down rotation.
%
%   This function is mutually exclusive with 'UsePanelFitter', but if you
%   need to use both, you can omit 'UseDisplayRotation' and pass the
%   'angle' parameter to 'UsePanelFitter' instead, which also accepts an
%   'angle' parameter with the same meaning.
%
%   This function is not very mature yet: If you want to use the
%   panelfitter for anything beyond simple framebuffer rotation by 90
%   degree increments, you will likely hit bugs or limitations which will
%   require significant tinkering by you.
%
%
% * 'UsePanelFitter' Ask to use builtin panel fitter. This allows you to
%   define a virtual size for your onscreen window. The window will behave
%   as if it had that virtual size wrt. all size queries and drawing
%   operations. However, at Screen('Flip') time, the visual content of the
%   window will be resized by a fast scaling operation to the real size of
%   the windows framebuffer, ie., its real onscreen size. Scaling uses
%   bilinear interpolation or better for high quality results. After
%   rescaling to the real size, post-processing and display of your
%   stimulus image will proceed at full resolution. This function is useful
%   if you want to display a stimulus designed for a specific display
%   resolution on a display device of different higher or lower resolution.
%   Given that size and shape of the virtual framebuffer and real display
%   window may not match, the function provides you with multiple possible
%   choices on how to rescale your stimulus image, e.g., to maximize
%   display area, or to preserve the aspect ratio of the original image,
%   trading off displayed area etc.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UsePanelFitter', size, strategy [, srcRect, dstRect][, angle]);
%
%   'size' is a [width, height] vector defining the width x height of the
%   virtual window in pixels.
%
%   'strategy' a text string selecting the scaling method. Following settings are possible:
%
%   'Full' - Scale to full window size. Aspect ratio is not preserved,
%            unless the virtual window and the real onscreen windows 'rect'
%            already have the same aspect ratio, in which case this will be
%            a simple scaling operation.
%
%   'Aspect' - Scale to maximum size possible while preserving aspect
%              ratio. This will center the stimulus and add black
%              horizontal or vertical borders as neccessary.
%
%   'AspectWidth' - Scale aspect ratio preserving to cover full display
%                   width. Cut off top and bottom content if neccessary.
%
%   'AspectHeight' - Scale aspect ratio preserving to cover full display
%                    height. Cut off left and right content if neccessary.
%
%   'Centered' - Center stimulus without any scaling, add black borders
%                around stimulus or cut away border regions to get a
%                one-to-one mapping.
%
%   'Custom' - This works like the 'srcRect' and 'dstRect' parameters of
%              Screen('DrawTexture'): Cut out a 'srcRect' region from the
%              virtual framebuffer and display it in the 'dstRect' region.
%              'srcRect' and 'dstRect' are given in typical [left, top, right, bottom]
%              format.
%
%   'angle' is an optional rotation angle. If provided and non-zero, the
%   panelfitter will also rotate the output framebuffer by the given
%   rotation angle. Note: This doesn't work very well yet with most
%   framebuffer sizes and scaling strategies. What does work is if the
%   specified 'size' is identical to the onscreen windows size, or is its
%   transposed size (ie., if window is width x height pixels, then height x
%   width pixels will work as 'size' parameter) and the rotation angle is a
%   multiple of 90 degrees. This is mostly useful for display rotation from
%   landscape orientation into portrait orientation. Your mileage with
%   other configurations or rotation angles will vary.
%
%   Example: Suppose your real window covers a 1920 x 1080 display.
%
%   PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UsePanelFitter', [800 600], 'Aspect');
%   -> This would give you a virtual window of 800 x 600 pixels to draw
%   into and would rescale the 800 x 600 stimulus image to 1440 x 1080
%   pixels and display it centered on the 1920 x 1080 pixels display.
%   Aspect ratio would be correct and the image would cover the full height
%   1080 pixels of the display, but only 1440 out of 1920 pixels of its
%   width, thereby leaving black borders on the left and right side of your
%   stimulus.
%
%   PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UsePanelFitter', [800 600], 'AspectHeight');
%   -> Would do the same as above.
%
%   PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UsePanelFitter', [800 600], 'AspectWidth');
%   -> Would create a final image of 1920 pixels width, as you asked to
%   cover the full display width, aspect ratio would be correct, but the
%   top and bottom 75 pixels of your original stimulus would get cut away,
%   because they wouldn't fit after scaling without distorting the image.
%
%
% * 'UseFastOffscreenWindows' Ask for support of fast Offscreen windows.
%   These use a more efficient storage, backed by OpenGL framebuffer
%   objects (FBO's). Drawing into them isn't faster, but *switching*
%   between drawing into onscreen- and offscreen windows, or switching
%   between drawing into different offscreen windows is faster. They also
%   support a couple of other advanced features and performance
%   improvements in conjunction with the imaging pipeline.
%   If you only specify this task, then you'll get the benefit of fast
%   windows, without the cost of other features of the pipeline you might
%   not need.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UseFastOffscreenWindows');
%
%
% * 'EnableCLUTMapping' Enable support for old-fashioned clut animation /
%   clut mapping. The drawn framebuffer image is transformed by applying a
%   color lookup table (clut). This is not done via the hardware gamma
%   tables as in the good ol' days, but by application of the clut via
%   image processing. Hardware gamma tables don't provide well defined
%   timing on modern hardware, therefore they aren't suitable anymore.
%
%   You can update the clut to be applied at the next Screen('Flip');
%   via the command Screen('LoadNormalizedGammatable', windowPtr, clut, 2);
%
%   'clut' needs to be a clutSize-by-3 matrix, with 'clutSize' slots and
%   one column for each of the red, green and blue color channels.
%
%   Setup command:
%
%   By default, a clut of 256 slots with (R,G,B) values is used, but you
%   can provide the optional 'clutSize' parameter to use clut's with more
%   slots. The maximum number depends on your GPU, but 2048 are typically
%   supported even on very low-end cards.
%
%   If you set 'highprecision' to 1, the clut will resolve values at more
%   than 8 bit per color channel on modern hardware. This usually only
%   makes sense if you also use a more than 8 bpc framebuffer with more
%   than 256 slots as clutSize.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', whichView, 'EnableCLUTMapping' [, clutSize=256][, highprecision=0]);
%   Example: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'AllViews', 'EnableCLUTMapping');
%
%
% * 'FloatingPoint16Bit' Ask for a 16 bit floating point precision
%   framebuffer. This allows more than 8 bit precision for complex drawing,
%   compositing and image processing operations. It also allows
%   alpha-blending with signed color values and intermediate results that
%   are outside the displayable range, e.g., negative. Precision is about 3
%   digits behind the decimal point or 1024 discriminable displayable
%   levels. If you need higher precision, choose 'FloatingPoint32Bit'.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'FloatingPoint16Bit');
%
%
% * 'FixedPoint16Bit' Ask for a 16 bit integer precision framebuffer.
%   On graphics hardware that supports this, a 16 bit signed integer
%   framebuffer will be created. Such a framebuffer can store intermediate
%   color values in the normalized range [-1.0 ; +1.0] with a precision of
%   15 bits per component. Only positive values between 0.0 and 1.0 are
%   displayable in the end though. If the graphics hardware does not support this,
%   a 16 bit unsigned integer framebuffer is tried instead. Such a framebuffer
%   allows for 16 bits of precision per color component. However, many graphics
%   cards do not support alpha-blending on such a framebuffer, and
%   intermediate out-of-range values (smaller than zero or bigger than one) aren't
%   supported either. Such values will be clamped to the representable [0.0 ; 1.0]
%   range instead. Additionally this mode is only supported on some graphics
%   hardware. It is a special purpose intermediate solution - more accurate
%   than 16 bit floating point, but less capable and less accurate than 32
%   bit floating point. If you need higher precision, choose 'FloatingPoint32Bit'.
%
%   The main sad reason this switch exists is because some graphics hardware or
%   graphics drivers do not support floating point precision textures and
%   framebuffers due to some ridiculous patent restrictions, but they do
%   support a 16 bit signed or unsigned integer precision format. The switch
%   is basically a workaround for the broken patent systems of many countries.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'FixedPoint16Bit');
%
%
% * 'FloatingPoint32Bit' Ask for a 32 bit floating point precision
%   framebuffer. This allows more than 8 bit precision for complex drawing,
%   compositing and image processing operations. It also allows
%   alpha-blending with signed color values and intermediate results that
%   are outside the displayable range, e.g., negative. Precision is about
%   6.5 digits behind the dezimal point or 8 million discriminable displayable
%   levels. Be aware that only the most recent hardware (NVidia Geforce
%   8000 series, ATI Radeon HD 2000 series) is able to perform
%   alpha-blending at full speed in this mode. Enabling alpha-blending on
%   older hardware may cause a significant decrease in drawing performance,
%   or alpha blending may not work at all at this precision! If you'd like
%   to have both, the highest precision and support for alpha-blending,
%   specify 'FloatingPoint32BitIfPossible' instead. PTB will then try to
%   use 32 bit precision if this is possible in combination with alpha
%   blending. Otherwise, it will choose 16 bit precision for drawing &
%   blending, but 32 bit precision at least for the post-processing.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'FloatingPoint32Bit');
%
%
% * 'FloatingPoint32BitIfPossible' Ask PTB to choose the highest precision
%   that is possible on your hardware without sacrificing functionality like,
%   e.g., alpha-blending. PTB will choose the best compromise possible for
%   your hardware setup.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'FloatingPoint32BitIfPossible');
%
%
% * 'NormalizedHighresColorRange' Ask PTB to use a normalized range of
%   color and luminance intensity levels in the interval [0; 1], ie. values
%   between zero and one for minimum and maximum intensity. Also ask for
%   unclamped colors -- intermediate results are allowed to take on
%   arbitrary values, e.g., also negative values. All Screen() 2D drawing
%   commands should operate at maximum color/luminance precision.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'NormalizedHighresColorRange' [, applyAlsoToMakeTexture]);
%
%   The command PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'NormalizedHighresColorRange', 1);
%   is automatically executed if you used PsychDefaultSetup(featureLevel)
%   with a featureLevel of >= 2 at the top of your experiment script,
%   *except* that clamping is *not* disabled by default in this case! To
%   disable clamping you'd still need to add this task explicitely, as
%   unclamping may have unintended side effects on old graphics hardware.
%
%   The optional flag 'applyAlsoToMakeTexture' defaults to zero. If set to 1,
%   then a unit color range of expected input values in the [0; 1] range is
%   also applied to standard 8-Bit precision textures in Screen('MakeTexture')
%   if the provided Matlab imageMatrix is of double precision type instead of
%   uint8 type. This allows to specify standard textures in the same consistent
%   value range 0-1 as other drawing colors, for cleaner code. Such textures
%   will still be limited to 0-1 range and only resolved into 256 intensity
%   levels, unless you also set the optional 'floatprecision' flag in Screen('MakeTexture')
%   to a value of 1 or 2. We still apply this limitation, as high precision textures consume
%   more memory and other resources and are incompatible with very old graphics
%   hardware.
%
%   This is just a convenience shortcut for Screen('ColorRange', win, 1, 0, applyAlsoToMakeTexture);
%   with the added benefit of allowing to specify the background clear
%   color in normalized 0-1 range as well. This command is implied by use
%   of any of the high precision display device drivers (for attenuators,
%   Bits+ box etc.). It is only needed if you want to create the same
%   visual results on a 8 bit standard framebuffer without needing to
%   change your code, or if you want to set the 'applyAlsoToMakeTexture' flag to a
%   setting of non-zero, so unit colorrange also applies to Screen('MakeTexture').
%
%
% * 'StereoCrosstalkReduction' If a stereoMode is active or requested,
%   apply a shader first in the processing chain that for each eye aims to
%   reduce crosstalk from the other eye.
%
%   Usage:
%
%     PsychImaging('AddTask', 'LeftView', 'StereoCrosstalkReduction', method, crossTalkGain);
%     PsychImaging('AddTask', 'RightView', 'StereoCrosstalkReduction', method, crossTalkGain);
%
%   The 'method' parameter selects the method to use for crosstalk
%   reduction.
%
%   Currently only a method named 'SubtractOther' is implemented, which works as follows:
%
%   To reduce crosstalk, the contrast in the image of each eye, i.e., the
%   difference in color from the background level provided as background
%   clear color of the window is subtracted from the image of the other eye,
%   after scaling the contrast by 'crossTalkGain'. 'crossTalkGain' can be a
%   scalar, or a separate gain for each RGB channel. The background color
%   can be a scalar in the range 0-1, or a 3-element array to set the
%   backgroundlevel for each RGB channel separately. The background
%   color level should not be zero, as contrast then can't be inverted
%   around the background level. In general, the background level
%   should be high enough to allow unclamped inversion of the highest
%   contrast features of your stimulus at your 'crossTalkGain', or
%   artifacts will occur.

% * 'DisplayColorCorrection' Select a method for color correction to apply to
%   stimuli before output conversion and display. You have to specify a
%   color correction method 'methodname' to apply as parameter, see "help
%   PsychColorCorrection" for an overview of supported color correction
%   methods and their adjustable parameters. The imaging pipeline will be
%   set up to support the chosen color correction method. After you've
%   opened the onscreen window, you can use the different subcommands of
%   PsychColorCorrection() to change parameters of the color correction
%   algorithm at runtime.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', whichView, 'DisplayColorCorrection', methodname);
%
%   Example: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'FinalFormatting', 'DisplayColorCorrection', 'SimpleGamma');
%   This would apply a simple power-law gamma correction to all view
%   channels of a stereo setup, or the single view of a monoscopic setup.
%   Later on you could use the methods of PsychColorCorrection() to
%   actually set the wanted gamma correction factors.
%
%   Please note that we use the channel 'FinalFormatting' instead of
%   'AllViews' as we'd usually do. Both specs will work, but a selection
%   of 'FinalFormatting' will lead to faster processing in many cases, so
%   this is preferred here if you want to apply the same setting to all
%   view channels - or to a single monoscopic display. Should you find 
%   that things don't work as expected, you might try 'AllViews' instead
%   of 'FinalFormatting' - There are subtle differences in how they
%   process your instructions, which may matter in some corner cases.
%
%
% * 'EnablePseudoGrayOutput' Enable the high-performance driver for the
%   rendering of up to 1786 different levels of gray on a standard - but
%   well calibrated - color monitor and 8 bit graphics card. This is done
%   by applying an algorithn known as "Pseudo-Gray" or "Bit stealing".
%   Selecting this mode implies use of 32 bit floating point
%   framebuffers, unless you specify use of a 16 bit floating point
%   framebuffer via 'FloatingPoint16Bit' explicitely. If you do that, you
%   will not quite be able to use the full 10.8 bit output precision, but
%   only approximately 10 bits. The expected range of luminance values is
%   between 0 and 1. See "help CreatePseudoGrayLUT" for further
%   explanation.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnablePseudoGrayOutput');
%
%
% * 'EnableGenericHighPrecisionLuminanceOutput'
%   Setup Psychtoolbox for conversion of high precision luminance images
%   into a format suitable for special high precision luminance display
%   devices. This is a generic support routine that uses LUT based
%   conversion.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableGenericHighPrecisionLuminanceOutput', lut);
%
%
% * 'EnableVideoSwitcherSimpleLuminanceOutput'
%   Setup Psychtoolbox for conversion of high precision luminance images
%   into a format suitable for driving the "VideoSwitcher" high precision
%   luminance display device which was developed by Xiangrui Li et al.
%
%   This implements the simple converter, which only needs the
%   Blue-To-Red-Ratio of the device as input parameter and performs
%   conversion via a closed-form formula without any need for lookup
%   tables. This is supposed to be fast.
%
%   See "help VideoSwitcher" for more info about the device and its
%   options.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableVideoSwitcherSimpleLuminanceOutput' [, btrr] [, trigger]);
%
%   - The optional 'btrr' parameter is the Blue-To-Red-Ratio to use. If the
%   parameter is left out, the btrr value will be read from a global
%   configuration file.
%
%   - The optional 'trigger' parameter can be zero for "No trigger", or 1
%   for "Use trigger as configured". By default, trigger is off (==0).
%   Enabled, one can use the VideoSwitcher('SetTrigger', ...); function to
%   configure when and how a trigger signal should be emitted. Trigger
%   signals are simply specific pixel patterns in the green output channel.
%   That channel is recognized by the VideoSwitcher as a trigger signal
%   control channel.
%
%
% * 'EnableVideoSwitcherCalibratedLuminanceOutput'
%   Setup Psychtoolbox for conversion of high precision luminance images
%   into a format suitable for driving the "VideoSwitcher" high precision
%   luminance display device which was developed by Xiangrui Li et al.
%
%   This implements the simple converter, which only needs the
%   Blue-To-Red-Ratio of the device as input parameter and performs
%   conversion via a closed-form formula without any need for lookup
%   tables. This is supposed to be fast.
%
%   See "help VideoSwitcher" for more info about the device and its
%   options.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableVideoSwitcherCalibratedLuminanceOutput' [, btrr] [, lut] [, trigger]);
%
%   - The optional 'btrr' parameter is the Blue-To-Red-Ratio to use. If the
%   parameter is left out, the btrr value will be read from a global
%   configuration file.
%
%   - The optional 'lut' paramter is a 257 elements vector of luminance
%   values, which maps blue channel drive indices to luminance values. This
%   lut needs to be acquired via a calibration procedure by use of a
%   photometer. If 'lut' is left out, the table will be read from a global
%   configuration file.
%
%   - The optional 'trigger' parameter can be zero for "No trigger", or 1
%   for "Use trigger as configured". By default, trigger is off (==0).
%   Enabled, one can use the VideoSwitcher('SetTrigger', ...); function to
%   configure when and how a trigger signal should be emitted. Trigger
%   signals are simply specific pixel patterns in the green output channel.
%   That channel is recognized by the VideoSwitcher as a trigger signal
%   control channel.
%
%
% * 'EnableNative10BitFramebuffer' Enable support for output of stimuli
%   with 10 bit precision per color channel (10 bpc / 30 bpp / "Deep color")
%   on graphics hardware that supports native 10 bpc framebuffers.
%
%   Many graphics cards of the professional class AMD/ATI Fire series 
%   (2008 models and later) and all current models of the professional class
%   NVidia Quadro series (2008 models and later), as well as all current models
%   of the consumer class NVidia GeForce series under Linux, do support 10 bpc
%   framebuffers under some circumstances. 10 bpc display on classic CRT monitors
%   which are connected via analog VGA outputs is supported. Support for digital
%   display devices like LCD/OLED panels or video projectors depends on the specific
%   type of display output connector used, the specific panels, and their video
%   settings. Consult manufacturer documentation for details. In general, 10 bpc
%   output may be supported on some graphics cards and displays via DisplayPort
%   or HDMI video outputs, but to our knowledge not via DVI-D outputs.
%
%   If such a combination of graphics card and display is present on your system
%   on Linux or Microsoft Windows, then Psychtoolbox will request native support
%   from the standard graphics drivers, ie., it won't need to use our own
%   homegrown, experimental box of tricks to enable this.
%
%   Apple OSX, as of version 10.9 "Mavericks", does not support 10 bpc framebuffers,
%   so 10 bpc output will only work with our own box of tricks - if at all.
%
%   Psychtoolbox experimental 10 bpc framebuffer support:
%
%   Additionally we support ATI/AMD Radeon hardware of the X1000, HD2000 - HD8000,
%   series and later models under Linux and OSX via our own low-level setup mechanisms.
%   These models support a native ARGB2101010 framebuffer, ie., a system
%   framebuffer with 2 bits for the alpha channel, and 10 bits per color channel.
%
%   As this is supported by the hardware, but not by the standard ATI
%   graphics drivers, we follow a hybrid approach: We use a special kernel
%   level driver to reconfigure the hardware for 10 bpc framebuffer support.
%   Then we use a special imaging pipeline formatting plugin to convert
%   16 bpc or 32 bpc stimuli into the special data format required by this
%   framebuffer configuration.
%
%   You'll need to install and load the special Psychtoolbox kernel driver
%   on OSX. On Linux you must have run PsychLinuxConfiguration at least once
%   on your system at some point. You'll need to have one of the supported AMD
%   Radeon gfx-cards (see above) for this to work. Read 'help PsychtoolboxKernelDriver'
%   for info about the driver and installation instructions on OSX.
%
%   CAUTION: Support for 10 bpc framebuffers on AMD Radeon graphics cards
%   under OSX is highly experimental and not guaranteed to work reliably on
%   any system configuration. While it has been successfully tested on multiple
%   versions of OSX (10.4, 10.5, 10.6 and 10.8) with some X1000 cards,
%   some HD2000/3000 cards and HD 4870 cards, this feature could fail on other
%   systems or even after any operating system upgrade! Use at your own risk and
%   verify proper operation carefully before production use. The same experimental
%   status is true for use on Linux with the proprietary AMD Catalyst graphics drivers.
%   If you use Linux with the free and open-source AMD graphics drivers, 10 bpc
%   framebuffer support should work reliably, so use of the open-source drivers on
%   Linux is recommended for reliable results.
%
%   Getting a 10 bpc framebuffer working is only the first half of what you need for
%   high color precision output. Your graphics card must also be able to transmit the
%   video signal at high precision to the display device and the display must be able
%   to faithfully reproduce the high precision image. 10 bpc output has been verified
%   to work for analog VGA connected CRT monitors and displays on both AMD and
%   NVidia graphics cards which do support 10 bpc framebuffers, so with a analog VGA
%   CRT you should be safe. The status of 10 bpc output to digital display devices differs
%   a lot across devices and OS'es. Output of 10 bpc framebuffers to standard 8 bpc digital panels
%   via digital dithering is known to work, but that is not the real thing, only a simulation
%   of 10 bpc via dithering to 8 bpc. This may or may not be good enough for your specific
%   visual stimulation paradigm. On a DVI-D connected digital display, this dithered output
%   is the best you will ever get. DisplayPort: Recent NVidia and AMD graphics cards can
%   output to some suitable DisplayPort displays with 10 bpc or higher precision on Linux,
%   and maybe also on MS-Windows, but you have to verify this carefully for your specific display.
%   HDMI: Recent Intel graphics cards can output up to 12 bpc precision to HDMI deep color
%   capable displays on Linux, and maybe also on MS-Windows. All AMD graphics cards of model
%   Radeon HD-5000 or later (and equivalent Fire-Series models) can output to HDMI deep color
%   capable displays with 10 bpc real precision at least if you use a Linux kernel of version 3.16
%   or later with the open-source AMD graphics drivers. At least on Linux 3.16 you will need to add
%   the kernel command line option "radeon.deep_color=1" to the kernel boot loader options, e.g.,
%   by editing /etc/default/grub and running "sudo update-grub2" afterwards. This because deep
%   color output is disabled by default, to work around various broken hdmi display devices.
%
%   The status with the proprietary AMD drivers on Linux or on MS-Windows is unknown.
%   Apple OSX 10.9 and earlier do not support any high precision video output over any digital
%   output, neither DVI-D, nor DisplayPort or HDMI. All you'll get at best on OSX is simulated > 8
%   bpc via dithering.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableNative10BitFramebuffer' [, disableDithering=0]);
%
%   This function will setup a 32 bpc floating point resolution framebuffer by
%   default for Psychtoolbox drawing and stimulus processing. Output will happen
%   into a 10 bpc framebuffer. The function will also disable the graphics cards
%   gamma tables, so you'll need to use PsychImaging(...'DisplayColorCorrection'...)
%   for gamma and color correction if you need this.
%
%   The function will *not* disable dithering on digital displays by default,
%   but leave that decision to the operating system and graphics drivers of
%   your machine. A well working OS would disable dithering on a 10 bpc or
%   higher color depth display, if the display reports its capability to the
%   OS via its EDID info. It would enable dithering on < 10 bpc displays, so
%   you'd get a "pseudo 10 bpc" display where 10 bpc color depths is
%   simulated on a 6 bpc or 8 bpc display via the dithering.
%
%   You can disable dithering manually on some graphics cards by providing the
%   optional 'disableDithering' flag as 1. Currently mostly AMD cards allow this
%   control. NVidia or Intel cards require manual setup to force dithering off.
%
%
% * 'EnableNative11BitFramebuffer' Enable support for output of stimuli
%   with almost 11 bit precision per color channel (11 bpc / 32 bpp / "Deep color")
%   on graphics hardware that supports native 11 bpc framebuffers. This will
%   request an ~ 11 bpc framebuffer from the operating system. If it can't
%   get such a framebuffer on Linux or OSX with AMD graphics hardware,
%   it will use our own homegrown setup code to provide such a framebuffer
%   anyway on Radeon X1000, HD-2000 and later graphics cards and equivalent
%   Fire-Series graphics cards.
%
%   Read all the explanations in the section above for 'EnableNative10BitFramebuffer'
%   for capabilities, limitations and possible caveats on different systems.
%
%   Please note that this "11 Bit framebuffer" is not quite 11 bpc precision, but
%   only about ~ 10.6666 bpc precision. Specifically, the framebuffer can only
%   store at most 32 bits of color information per pixel, so it will store 11 bit
%   precision for the red channel (2048 distinct red intensity levels), 11 bit
%   (2048 levels) for the green channel, but only 10 bit (1024 levels) for the blue
%   channel, for a total number of 11 + 11 + 10 bits = 32 bits of color information
%   per pixel, or 4 billion different possible colors. A true 11 bpc framebuffer would
%   need 33 bits per pixel, and current graphics hardware can't handle that.
%
%   How many bits of precision of these ~ 11 bpc actually reach your display device?
%   - Analog VGA only provides for maximum 10 bpc output precision on all shipping
%     NVidia and AMD graphics cards. Intel graphics cards only allow for 8 bpc.
%   - DisplayPort or HDMI might allow for transfer of 11 bpc precision, in general they
%     support up to 12 bpc. However additional hardware restrictions for your graphics
%     card may limit precision to as low as 10 bpc. To our knowledge, only AMD graphics
%     cards support ~ 11 bpc framebuffers at all. Radeon HD-7000 and earlier can only
%     truly process up to 10 bpc, so 'EnableNative11BitFramebuffer' may not gain you any
%     precision over 'EnableNative10BitFramebuffer' in practice on these cards. AMD cards
%     of the "Sea Islands" family or later, mostly models from the year 2014, should be able
%     to process and output up to 12 bpc over HDMI or DisplayPort, so they'd be able to output
%     true ~11 bpc images. However, this hasn't been verified by us so far due to lack of
%     suitable hardware.
%
%   So obviously: Measure very carefully on your setup what kind of precision you really
%   get and make sure not to be fooled by dithering.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableNative11BitFramebuffer' [, disableDithering=0]);
%
%
% * 'EnableNative16BitFramebuffer'  Enable up to 16 bpc, 64 bpp framebuffer on some setups.
%   This asks to enable a framebuffer with a color depth of up to 16 bpc for up to 65535 levels
%   of intensity per red, green and blue channel or 48 bits = different 2^48 colors. Currently,
%   as of September 2014, this mode of operation is only supported on Linux when using the
%   open-source FOSS radeon graphics drivers on modern AMD graphics cards, and only after
%   some special configuration of your X-Server and display setup has been performed by you.
%   This is essentially a low-level hack that works under those specific conditions, but uses a
%   relatively large amount of graphics memory and compute resources to implement. If you can
%   do with less than 12 bpc, you're better off with the other high bit depth modes, as they are
%   easier to set up and more efficient/faster in operation. On suitable setups, this will establish
%   a 16 bpc framebuffer which packs 3 * 16 bpc = 48 bit color info into 64 bpp pixels and the
%   gpu's display engine will scan out that framebuffer at 16 bpc. However, effective output
%   precision is further limited to < 16 bpc by your display, video connection and specific model
%   of graphics card. As of September 2014, the maximum effective output precision is limited
%   to 12 bpc (4096 levels of red, green and blue) by the graphics card, and this precision is only
%   attainable on the latest generation of AMD graphics cards of the so called "Sea Islands" family.
%   High bit depth output only works over HDMI or DisplayPort, and may be further restricted by
%   your specific display device, so measure your results carefully! See the sections about 11 bpc and
%   10 bpc native framebuffers above for further details.
%
%   Required manual one time setup:
%
%   1. You must create a custom made xorg.conf file for your graphics card and X-Server to setup
%      the display screen for use of a linear, non-tiled framebuffer at a color depth of 24 bit.
%      If you only have a single AMD graphics card installed in your Linux machine, the most easy
%      way to achieve this is to copy our simple template xorg.conf file into the config folder of
%      your machine:
%
%      a) Open a terminal window and use sudo cp to copy our template to the /etc/X11 folder:
%      sudo cp /path/to/Psychtoolbox/PsychGLImageProcessing/xorg.conf_For_AMD16bpcFramebuffer /etc/X11/xorg.conf
%
%      b) Logout and login again, so the display server picks up the changed configuration.
%
%      If you need a more customized xorg.conf file for special settings or for more complex display and
%      gpu setups, use our template file as a reference. The important bit is to add the "ColorTiling..."
%      lines to the "Device" section for your AMD graphics card.
%
%   2. Only three distinct display setups are allowed: Either a single display connected, or if multiple
%      displays are conected, all displays must mirror (aka clone) each other showing the same image,
%      or a dual display setup with both displays running at the same video resolution, one display
%      showing the left half of your onscreen window, the other showing the right half of your onscreen
%      window, ie., a typical setup for dual-display side-by-side stereo presentation. Pretty much any other
%      display setup will display undefined results, e.g., corrupted images or random pixel trash.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableNative16BitFramebuffer' [, disableDithering=0][, bpc]);
%
%
% * 'EnableBrightSideHDROutput' Enable the high-performance driver for
%   BrightSide Technologies High dynamic range display device for 16 bit
%   per color channel output precision. See "help BrightSideHDR" for
%   detailed explanation. Please note that you'll need to install the 3rd
%   party driver libraries for that display as described in the help file.
%   PTB doesn't come bundled with that libraries for copyright reasons.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableBrightSideHDROutput');
%
%
% * 'UseDataPixx' Tell Psychtoolbox that additional functionality for
%   displaying the onscreen window on a VPixx Technologies DataPixx device
%   should be enabled.
%
%   This command is implied by enabling a DataPixx video mode by one of the
%   commands for the DataPixx in the following sections.
%
%   'UseDataPixx' mostly prepares use of a variety of subfunctions in the
%   DataPixxToolbox ("help DataPixxToolbox") and in the PsychDataPixx()
%   high-level driver ("help PsychDataPixx").
%
%
% * 'EnableDataPixxL48Output' Setup Psychtoolbox for L48 mode of the VPixx
%   Technologies DataPixx device. This loads the graphics hardwares gamma
%   table with an identity mapping so it can't interfere with DPixx video
%   processing. It also sets up automatic generation of control signals to
%   support the features of DPixx that are available via the functions in
%   PsychDataPixx(). You will be able to upload new CLUT's into the DPixx
%   by use of the Screen('LoadNormalizedGammaTable', window, clut, 2);
%   command. CLUT updates will be synchronized with Screen('Flip') commands.
%   Please note that while L48 CLUT mode works even with very old
%   graphics hardware, this is a pretty cumbersome way of driving the
%   DPixx. On recent hardware, you will want to use M16 or C48 mode
%   (see below). That allows to draw arbitrarily complex stimuli with as
%   many colors as you want and PTB will take care of conversion into the
%   M16 or C48 format for DataPixx.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableDataPixxL48Output');
%
%
% * 'EnableDataPixxM16Output' Enable the high-performance driver for M16
%   mode of the VPixx Technologies DataPixx device. This is the fastest and
%   most elegant way of driving the DPixx box with 16 bit luminance output
%   precision. See "help DataPixx" for more information. Selecting this
%   mode implies use of 32 bit floating point framebuffers, unless you
%   specify use of a 16 bit floating point framebuffer via
%   'FloatingPoint16Bit' explicitely. If you do that, you will not be able
%   to use the full 16 bit output precision, but only approximately 10 bits.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableDataPixxM16Output');
%
%   If you want to make use of the color overlay plane in M16 mode, then
%   call the function like this:
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableDataPixxM16OutputWithOverlay');
%   See the explanation of color overlays in the section
%   'EnableBits++Mono++OutputWithOverlay' - behaviour of color overlays is
%   identical for the CRS Bits++ and the VPixx DataPixx.
%
%
% * 'EnableDataPixxC48Output' Enable the high-performance driver for the
%   C48 mode of VPixx technologies DataPixx box. This is the fastest and
%   most elegant way of driving the DataPixx box with 16 bit per color
%   channel output precision. See "help DataPixx" for more information.
%   Selecting this mode implies use of 32 bit floating point framebuffers,
%   unless you specify use of a 16 bit floating point framebuffer via
%   'FloatingPoint16Bit' explicitely. If you do that, you will not be able
%   to use the full 16 bit output precision, but only approximately 10 bits.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableDataPixxC48Output', mode);
%
%   See the section below about 'EnableBits++Color++Output' for the meaning
%   of the mandatory "mode" parameter.
%
%   You can use the RemapMouse() function to correct GetMouse() positions
%   for potential geometric distortions introduced by this function for
%   "mode" zero.
%
%
% * 'UseBits#' Tell Psychtoolbox that additional functionality for
%   displaying the onscreen window on a Cambridge Research Systems Bits#
%   device should be enabled.
%
%   This command is implied by enabling a Bits+ or Bits# video mode by one
%   of the commands for the Bits+/Bits# in the following sections, if the
%   driver can auto-detect a connected Bits# device. If it cannot auto-detect
%   a connected Bits# device and this command is omitted, Psychtoolbox will
%   instead assume that an older Bits+ is in use and only allow functionality
%   common to Bits# and Bits+, without automatic video mode switching.
%
%   If you provide this command, you can optionally specify the name of the
%   serial port to which your Bits# is connected, instead of leaving it to
%   the system to find this out (either via configuration file or via a
%   guess-o-matic).
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UseBits#' [, BitsSharpSerialPort]);
%
%   'BitsSharpSerialPort' is optional and can be set to the name of a serial
%   port for your specific operating system and computer, to which the Bits#
%   is connected. If omitted, Psychtoolbox will look for the name in the first
%   line of text of a text file stored under the filesystem path and filename
%   [PsychtoolboxConfigDir 'BitsSharpConfig.txt']. If that file is empty, the
%   serial port is auto-detected (Good luck!).
%
%   'UseBits#' mostly prepares use of a variety of new Bits# subfunctions
%   in the BitsPlusPlus() high-level driver ("help BitsPlusPlus").
%
%
% * 'EnableBits++Bits++Output' Setup Psychtoolbox for Bits++ mode of the
%   Cambridge Research Systems Bits++ box. This loads the graphics
%   hardwares gamma table with an identity mapping so it can't interfere
%   with Bits++ T-Lock system. It also sets up automatic generation of
%   Bits++ T-Lock codes: You will be able to upload new CLUT's into the
%   Bits++ by use of the Screen('LoadNormalizedGammaTable', window, clut, 2);
%   command. CLUT updates will be synchronized with Screen('Flip')
%   commands, because PTB will generate and draw the proper T-Lock code
%   into the top line of your onscreen window. Please note that while
%   Bits++ CLUT mode works even with very old graphics hardware, this is a
%   pretty cumbersome way of driving the Bits++. On recent hardware, you
%   will want to use Mono++ or Color++ mode (see below). That allows to
%   draw arbitrarily complex stimuli with as many colors as you want and
%   PTB will take care of conversion into the Color++ or Mono++ format for
%   Bits++.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableBits++Bits++Output');
%
%
% * 'EnableBits++Mono++Output' Enable the high-performance driver for the
%   Mono++ mode of Cambridge Research Systems Bits++ box. This is the
%   fastest and most elegant way of driving the Bits++ box with 14 bit
%   luminance output precision. See "help BitsPlusPlus" for more
%   information. Selecting this mode implies use of 32 bit floating point
%   framebuffers, unless you specify use of a 16 bit floating point
%   framebuffer via 'FloatingPoint16Bit' explicitely. If you do that, you
%   will not be able to use the full 14 bit output precision of Bits++, but
%   only approximately 10 bits.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableBits++Mono++Output');
%
%   If you want to make use of the color overlay plane in Mono++ mode, then
%   call the function like this:
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableBits++Mono++OutputWithOverlay');
%
%   Then you can query the window handle of the overlay window via:
%
%   overlayWin = PsychImaging('GetOverlayWindow', window);
%
%   'overlayWin' is the handle to the overlay window associated with the
%   overlay of onscreen window 'window'. The overlay window is a standard
%   offscreen window, so you can do anything with it that you would want to
%   do with offscreen windows. The only difference is that the window is a
%   pure index window: It only has one "color channel", which can be written
%   with color values between 0 and 255. Values 1 to 255 get mapped to the
%   corresponding color indices of the Bits++ overlay plane: A zero value is
%   transparent -- Content of the onscreen window is visible. Positive
%   non-zero color values map to the 255 indices available in overlay mode,
%   these get mapped by the Bits++ CLUT to colors. You can define the
%   mapping of indices to CLUT colors via the
%   Screen('LoadNormalizedGammaTable', window, clut, 2); command.
%
%   Updates of the overlay image are synchronized to Screen('Flip')
%   updates. If you draw into the overlay window, the changed overlay image
%   will become visible at Screen('Flip') time -- in sync with the changed
%   onscreen window content. The overlay plane is not automatically cleared
%   to background (or transparent) color after a flip, but its content
%   persists across flips. You need to clear it out manually via a
%   Screen('FillRect') command.
%
%
% * 'EnableBits++Color++Output' Enable the high-performance driver for the
%   Color++ mode of Cambridge Research Systems Bits++ box. This is the
%   fastest and most elegant way of driving the Bits++ box with 14 bit
%   per color channel output precision. See "help BitsPlusPlus" for more
%   information. Selecting this mode implies use of 32 bit floating point
%   framebuffers, unless you specify use of a 16 bit floating point
%   framebuffer via 'FloatingPoint16Bit' explicitely. If you do that, you
%   will not be able to use the full 14 bit output precision of Bits++, but
%   only approximately 10 bits.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableBits++Color++Output', mode);
%
%   "mode" is a mandatory numeric parameter which must be 0, 1 or 2. In
%   Color++ mode, the effective horizontal display resolution is only half
%   the normal horizontal resolution. To cope with this, multiple different
%   methods are implemented to squeeze your stimulus image horizontally by
%   a factor of two. The following options exist:
%
%   0 = This is the "classic" mode which was used in all Psychtoolbox
%   versions prior to 22nd September 2010. If you want to keep old code
%   working as is, select 0. In this mode, your script will only see a
%   framebuffer that is half the true horizontal resolution of your
%   connected display screen. Each drawn pixel will be stretched to cover
%   two pixels on the output display device horizontally. While this
%   preserves the content of your stimulus image exactly, it means that the
%   aspect ratio of all displayed text and stimuli will be 2:1. Text will
%   be twice as wide as its height. Circles or squares will turn into
%   horizontal ellipses or rectangles etc. You'll need to do extra work in
%   your code if you want to preserve aspect ratio properly.
%
%   You can use the RemapMouse() function to correct GetMouse() positions
%   for potential geometric distortions introduced by this function for
%   "mode" zero.
%
%   Example: A fine vertical grid with alternating vertical white and black
%   lines would display as expected, but each white or black stripe would be
%   two pixels wide on the display instead of one pixel wide.
%
%   1 = Subsample: Your framebuffer will appear at the same resolution as
%   your display device. Aspect ratio of drawn stimuli/text etc. will be
%   correct and as expected. However, every 2nd column of pixels in your
%   stimulus (ie., all odd-numbered x-coordinates 1,3,5,7,...) will be
%   completely ignored, only even columns are used!
%
%   Example: A fine vertical grid with alternating vertical white and black
%   lines would display as a purely white image, as only the white pixels
%   in the even columns would be used, whereas the black pixels in the odd
%   columns would be ignored.
%
%   2 = Average: Your framebuffer will appear at the same resolution as
%   your display device. Aspect ratio of drawn stimuli/text etc. will be
%   correct and as expected. However, each pair of adjacent even/odd pixel
%   columns will be averaged before output. Stimulus pixels 0 and 1 will
%   contribute the mean color for display pixel 0. Pixels 2 and 3 will be
%   averaged into display pixel 1 and so on. Visually this gives the most
%   pleasing and smooth results, but if adjacent even/odd pixels don't have
%   the same color value, you'll obviously get an output color that is
%   neither the color of the even pixel nor the odd pixel, but the average
%   of both.
%
%   Example: A fine vertical grid with alternating vertical white and black
%   lines would display as a 50% gray image, as the alternating white and
%   black columns would be averaged into the average of white and black,
%   which is 50% gray.
%
%
% * 'EnableDualPipeHDROutput' Enable EXPERIMENTAL high-performance driver
%   for HDR display devices which are composites of two separate displays.
%
%   EXPERIMENTAL proof-of-concept code with no real function yet!
%
%   This is meant for high-precision luminance or color output. It implies
%   use of 32 bpc floating point framebuffers unless otherwise specified by
%   other calls to PsychImaging().
%
%   The pair of specially encoded output images that are derived from
%   content of the onscreen window shall be output to both, the display
%   associated with the screen given to PsychImaging('OpenWindow',...); and
%   on the screen with the index 'pipe1Screen', using appropriate encoding
%   to drive the HDR device or similar composite device.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'EnableDualPipeHDROutput', pipe1Screen [, pipe1Rectangle]);
%
%   Optionally you can pass a 'pipe1Rectangle' if the window with the
%   pipe1 image shall not fill the whole 'pipe1Screen', but only a
%   subregion 'pipe1Rectangle'.
%
%
% * 'AddOffsetToImage' Add a constant color- or intensity offset to the
%   drawn image, prior to all following image processing and post
%   processing operations:
%   Outimage(x,y) = Inimage(x,y) + Offset. If the framebuffer is in a color
%   display mode, the same offset will be added to all three color
%   channels.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', whichView, 'AddOffsetToImage', Offset);
%   Example: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'AllViews', 'AddOffsetToImage', 0.5);
%
%
% * 'MirrorDisplayTo2ndOutputHead' Mirror the content of the onscreen
%   window to given 2nd screen, ie., to a 2nd output connector (head)
%   of a dualhead graphics card. This should give the same result as if one
%   switches the graphics card into "Mirror mode" or "Clone mode" via the
%   display settings panel of your operating system. Use of the "Mirror
%   Mode" or "Clone Mode" of your operating system and graphics card is
%   preferable to use of this command, if that works for you. The OS
%   builtin facilities are usually faster, more efficient and thereby
%   more reliable wrt. timing and synchronization!
%
%   This function only works for monoscopic displays, ie., it can not be
%   used simultaneously with any stereo display mode. The reason is that it
%   internally uses stereomode 10 with a few modifications to get its job
%   done, so obviously neither mode 10 nor any other mode can be used
%   without interference.
%
%   Only use this function for mirroring onto the 2nd head of a dual-head
%   graphics card under MacOS/X, or if you need to mirror onto a 2nd head
%   on MS-Windows and can't use "desktop spanning" mode on Windows to
%   achieve dual display output. If possible on your setup and OS, rather use
%   'MirrorDisplayToSingleSplitWindow' (see below). That mode should work
%   well on dual-head graphics cards on MS-Windows or GNU/Linux, as well as
%   in conjunction with a hardware display splitter attached to a single
%   head on any operating system. It has the advantage of consuming less
%   memory and compute ressources, so it is potentially faster or provides
%   a more reliable overall timing.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'MirrorDisplayTo2ndOutputHead', mirrorScreen [, mirrorRectangle]);
%
%   The content of the onscreen window shall be shown not only on the
%   display associated with the screen given to PsychImaging('OpenWindow',
%   ...); but also (as a copy) on the screen with the index 'mirrorScreen'.
%
%   Optionally you can pass a 'mirrorRectangle' if the window with the
%   mirror image shall not fill the whole 'mirrorScreen', but only a
%   subregion 'mirrorRectangle'.
%
%
% * 'MirrorDisplayToSingleSplitWindow' Mirror the content of the onscreen
%   window to the right half of the desktop (if desktop spanning on a
%   dual-display setup is enabled) or the right-half of the virtual screen
%   if a display splitter (e.g., Matrox Dualhead2Go (TM)) is attached to a
%   single head of a graphics card. This should give the same result as if one
%   switches the graphics card into "Mirror mode" or "Clone mode" via the
%   display settings panel of your operating system. Use of the "Mirror
%   Mode" or "Clone Mode" of your operating system and graphics card is
%   preferable to use of this command, if that works for you. The OS
%   builtin facilities are usually faster, more efficient and thereby
%   more reliable wrt. timing and synchronization!
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'MirrorDisplayToSingleSplitWindow');
%
%   Optionally, you can add the command...
%   PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'DontUsePipelineIfPossible');
%   ... if you don't intend to use the imaging pipeline for anything else
%   than display mirroring. This will allow further optimizations.
%
%
% * 'RestrictProcessing' Restrict stimulus processing to a specific subarea
%   of the screen. If your visual stimulus only covers a subarea of the
%   display screen you can restrict PTB's output processing to that
%   subarea. This may save some computation time to allow for higher
%   display redraw rates.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', whichChannel, 'RestrictProcessing', ROI);
%
%   ROI is a rectangle defining the area to process ROI = [left top right bottom];
%   E.g., ROI = [400 400 800 800] would only create output pixels in the
%   screen area with top-left corner (400,400) and bottom-right corner
%   (800, 800).
%
%
% * 'FlipHorizontal' and 'FlipVertical' flip your output images
%   horizontally (left- and right interchanged) or vertically (upside down).
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', whichChannel, 'FlipHorizontal');
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', whichChannel, 'FlipVertical');
%
%   You can use the RemapMouse() function to correct GetMouse() positions
%   for potential geometric distortions introduced by this function.
%
%
% * 'GeometryCorrection' Apply some geometric warping operation during
%   rendering of the final stimulus image to correct for geometric
%   distortion of your physical display device. You need to measure the
%   geometric distortion of your display with a suitable calibration
%   procedure, then compute an inverse warp transformation to undo this
%   distortion, then provide that transformation to this function.
%
%   Usage: PsychImaging('AddTask', whichChannel, 'GeometryCorrection', calibfilename [, debugoutput] [, arg1], [arg2], ...);
%
%   'calibfilename' is the filename of a calibration file which specified
%   the type of undistortion to apply. Calibration files can be created by
%   interactive calibration procedures. See 'help CreateDisplayWarp' for a
%   list of calibration methods. One of the supported procedures is, e.g.,
%   "DisplayUndistortionBezier", read "help DisplayUndistortionBezier". The
%   recommended method for most cases is 'DisplayUndistortionBVL', read
%   "help DisplayUndistortionBVL" for help.
%
%   The optional flag 'debugoutput' if set to non-zero value will trigger
%   some debug output about the calibration with some calibration methods.
%
%   The optional 'arg1', 'arg2', ..., are optional parameters whose
%   meaning depends on the calibration method in use.
%
%   Use of geometry correction will break the 1:1 correspondence between
%   framebuffer pixel locations (x,y) and the mouse cursor position, ie. a
%   mouse cursor positioned at display position (x,y) will be no longer
%   pointing to framebuffer pixel (x,y). If you want to know which
%   pixel in your original stimulus image corresponds to a specific
%   physical display pixel (or mouse cursor position), use the function
%   RemapMouse() to perform the neccessary coordinate transformation.
%
%
% * 'UseVRHMD' Display this onscreen window on a "Virtual Reality" head mounted
%   display (HMD), e.g., the Oculus Rift DK1 or Rift DK2. This enables display of
%   stereoscopic visual stimuli on supported virtual reality headsets.
%   You need to have the neccessary vendor supplied VR runtimes installed for
%   this to work.
%
%   Simple usage:
%
%   The most simple way to setup a HMD for use is to add a call to
%   hmd = PsychVRHMD('AutoSetupHMD') instead of a call to
%   PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', UseVRHMD', ...). The 'AutoSetupHMD'
%   call would detect the first supported HMD device on your computer, connect to
%   it, then set it up with reasonable default operating parameters. Then it would
%   call this PsychImaging task to perform all required setup steps.
%
%   Advanced usage:
%
%     1. Open a connection to a HMD and get a handle for the device:
%        For example, if you wanted to use a Oculus Rift DK1 or DK2, you could
%        do:
%
%        hmd = PsychOculusVR('Open' ...);
%
%     2. Perform basic configuration of the HMD via the HMD specific driver.
%
%     3. Add a PsychImaging task for the HMD and pass in its device handle 'hmd':
%        PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'UseVRHMD', hmd);
%
%   This sequence will perform the necessary setup of panel fitter, stereo display
%   mode and image post-processing for geometry correction, color aberration
%   correction and vignette correction for a fullscreen window on the HMD.
%
%
% * More actions will be supported in the future. If you can think of an
%   action of common interest not yet supported by this framework, please
%   file a feature request on our Wiki (Mainpage -> Feature Requests).
%
%
% After adding all wanted task specifications and other requirements,
% call...
%
% [windowPtr, windowRect] = PsychImaging('OpenWindow', screenid, [backgroundcolor], ....);
%
% - Finishes the setup phase for imaging pipeline, creates a suitable onscreen
% window and performs all remaining configuration steps. After this
% command, your onscreen window will be ready for drawing and display of
% stimuli. All specified imaging operations will get automatically applied
% to your stimulus before stimulus onset.
%
%
% After the window has been opened you can call the following commands any
% time at runtime:
%
% PsychImaging('RestrictProcessingToROI', window, whichChannel, ROI);
% - Restrict the processing area of viewChannel 'whichChannel' of onscreen
% window 'window' to the rectangular subarea defined by 'ROI'. See the
% explanation above for subtask 'RestrictProcessing'. This does exactly the
% same but allows a dynamic change of the restricted area at any point
% during your experiment script.
%
%
% PsychImaging('UnrestrictProcessing', window, whichChannel);
% - Remove a restriction of the processing area of viewChannel
% 'whichChannel' of onscreen window 'window' to a previously defined
% subarea. Can be called anytime during your scripts execution.
%
%
% [overlaywin, overlaywinRect] = PsychImaging('GetOverlayWindow', win);
% - Will return the handle to the 'overlaywin'dow associated with the
% given 'win'dow, if any. Will abort with an error message if the 'win'dow
% doesn't have an associated overylay window.
% Currently, only the CRS Bits+ box in Mono++ mode and the VPixx DataPixx
% box in M16 mode does support overlays. Other output drivers don't support
% such a feature. See "help BitsPlusPlus" for subfunction
% 'GetOverlayWindow' for more explanations of the purpose and properties of
% overlay windows. The explanations apply to the DPixx device as well if it
% is opened in videomode 'M16WithOverlay'.
%
%
%
% The following commands are only for specialists:
%
% [imagingMode, needStereomode] = PsychImaging('FinalizeConfiguration');
% - Finish the configuration phase for this window. This will compute an
% optimal configuration for all stages of the pipeline, but won't apply it
% yet. You'll have to call Screen('OpenWindow', windowPtr, ......,
% imagingMode, ...); with the returned 'imagingMode' + any other options
% you'd like to have for your window. After that, you'll have to call
% PsychImaging('PostConfiguration') to really apply and setup all your
% configuration settings. If you don't have unusual needs, you can simplify
% these steps by simply calling PsychImaging('OpenWindow', ....);
% with the same parameters that you'd pass to Screen('OpenWindow', ....);
% PsychImaging will perform all necessary steps to upon return, you'll have
% your window properly configured.
%
%
% PsychImaging('PostConfiguration', windowPtr [, clearcolor]);
% - To be called after opening the onscreen window 'windowPtr'.
% Performs all the setup work to be done after the window was created.

    % If we made it up to here, then the display output configuration and framebuffer size etc.
    % is at least compatible with 16 bpc 64 bpp scanout.

    % As of September 2014, none of the commercially available gpu's has
    % a graphics driver which would support 16 bpc / 64 bpp framebuffers.
    % However, all recent AMD gpu's do support 16 bpc / 64 bpp framebuffers
    % in their scanout hardware, ie., storing 16 bpc formatted framebuffer
    % content and scanning it out. The actual display encoders do limit output
    % precision to way less than 16 bpc though, ie. not the whole display pipeline is
    % 16 bpc. So what we do on Linux with the FOSS AMD graphics drivers on
    % X11 + radeon-kms is we reprogram the scanout engine (crtc) to treat a
    % 32 bpp framebuffer of twice the width and height of the crtc's viewport
    % as a 64 bpp framebuffer of exactly the width and height of the crtc's
    % viewport. From the perspective of Linux and its graphics stack, what we
    % have is an oversized X-Screen twice the width and height of the selected
    % display resolution. From the perspective of the scanout hw we have an
    % exactly matching X-Screen with 64 bpp color format for 16 bpc scanout,
    % and half of all scanlines are dead/ignored. PTB needs to render into the
    % jumbo-size onscreen window/framebuffer/x-screen as if it is a 64 bpp fb,
    % using GLSL conversion shaders to convert its floating point framebuffers
    % content into a 64 bpp encoding. Usercode however should see an onscreen
    % window with the effective output size/resolution of the display, not the over-
    % sized resolution of the x-screen/fb. Therefore instruct Screen() to pretend
    % the onscreen window is only half the width/height of the true system back-
    % buffer: half the width/height of a twice width/height system fb == cancels
    % each other out for effective width/height == display width/height, and all
    % is good:
    if ~isASideBySideConfig
        % Only half-width if no secondary video output can cover the "right half"

    % Request 32bpc float FBO unless already a 16 bpc fixed point FBO

    % quite sufficient for 16 bpc linear output, 32 bpc float provides 23 bpc
