% What is the precision of the DACs on this graphics card?
% 
% At present you need to know the bit depth of your graphics board's DAC
% to determine how to write its CLUT, i.e. Screen 'SetClut' or 'Gamma'.
% Use this routine and ScreenUsesHighGammaBits, instead of the the brand-
% and platform-specific IsRadiusThunder10 and IsATIRadeon10, to keep your
% program as general as possible, not tied to particular hardware or
% platform.
% 
% The value is set in PrepareScreen.m.
% 
% See also LoadClut, ScreenPixelSize, ScreenUsesHighGammaBits, ScreenClutSize.
