function bounds=TextBounds(w,text,yPositionIsBaseline,centerTheText)
% bounds=TextBounds(window, string [, yPositionIsBaseline=0][, centerTheText=0])
%
% Returns the smallest enclosing rect for the drawn text, relative to the
% current location. This bound is based on the actual pixels drawn, so it
% incorporates effects of text smoothing, etc. "text" may be a cell array
% or matrix of 1 or more strings. The strings are drawn one on top of
% another, at the same initial position, before the bounds are calculated.
% This returns the smallest box that will contain all the strings. The
% prior contents of the scratch window are lost. Usually it should be an
% offscreen window, so the user won't see it. The scratch window should be
% at least twice as wide and high as the text, to cope with uncertainties
% about text direction (e.g. Hebrew) and some unusual characters that
% extend greatly to the left of their nominal starting point. If you only
% know your nominal text size and number of characters, you might do this
% to create your scratch window:
%
% Get the bounding box.
% textSize=48;
% string='Good morning.';
% yPositionIsBaseline=1; % 0 or 1
% w=Screen('OpenWindow',0,255);
% woff=Screen('OpenOffscreenWindow',w,[],[0 0 2*textSize*length(string) 2*textSize]);
% Screen(woff,'TextFont','Arial');
% Screen(woff,'TextSize',textSize);
% t=GetSecs;
% bounds=TextBounds(woff,string,yPositionIsBaseline)
% fprintf('TextBounds took %.3f seconds.\n',GetSecs-t);
% Screen('Close',woff);
%
% Show that it's correct by using the bounding box to frame the text.
% x0=100;
% y0=100;
% Screen(w,'TextFont','Arial');
% Screen(w,'TextSize',textSize);
% Screen('DrawText',w,string,x0,y0,0,255,yPositionIsBaseline);
% Screen('FrameRect',w,0,InsetRect(OffsetRect(bounds,x0,y0),-1,-1));
% Screen('Flip',w);
% Speak('Click to quit');
% GetClicks;
% Screen('Close',w);
%
% The suggested window size in that call is generously large because there
% aren't any guarantees from the font makers about how big the text might
% be for a specified point size. Set your window's font, size, and
% (perhaps) style before calling TextBounds.
%
% Be warned that TextBounds and TextCenteredBounds are slow (taking many
% seconds) if the window is large. They use the whole window, so if the
% window is 1024x1024 they process a million pixels. The two slowest calls
% are Screen 'GetImage' and FIND. Their processing time is proportional to
% the number of pixels in the window. So keep your window small.
%
% Also see Screen 'TextBounds'.

% 9/1/98   dgp wrote it.
% 3/19/00  dgp debugged it.
% 11/17/02 dgp Added fix, image1(:,:,1),  suggested by Keith Schneider to
%              support 16 and 32 bit images.
% 9/16/04  dgp Suggest a pixelSize of 1.
% 12/16/04 dgp Fixed handling of cell array.
% 12/17/04 dgp Round x0 so bounds will always be integer. Add comment about speed.
% 1/18/05  dgp Added Charles Collin's two e suggestion for textHeight.
% 1/28/05  dgp Cosmetic.
% 2/4/05   dgp Support both OSX and OS9.
% 12/22/07 mk  Significant rewrite to adapt to current PTB-3.
% 12/16/15 dgp Added yPositionIsBaseline argument.
% 01/10/16 mk  Switch GetImage buffer from backBuffer to drawBuffer for compat with
%              use of onscreen window as scratch window with imaging pipeline active.
% 01/6/17  dgp Added fourth argument to implement the tiny change needed for
%              TextCenteredBounds. This makes TextCenteredBounds a trivial wrapper that
%              automatically tracks improvements made to TextBounds.
