% DrawHighQualityUnicodeTextDemo
%
% This demo shows how to draw high-quality, anti-aliased text, and some
% japanese text encoded in Unicode.
%
% MacOS/X has text fonts with support for japanese characters preinstalled,
% so this should just work out of the box. Have a look at the code of the
% demo on how to select a suitable font, and how to read unicode text from
% the filesystem. The (commented out) reading code for SHIFT_JIS -> Unicode
% conversion would only work on recent Matlab releases. Older releases need
% different approaches - also different wrt. PowerPC vs. IntelMac. That's
% why we hard-coded the text in this demo -- Want to have it working even
% on old Matlab 6...
% 
% On MS-Windows you will need to install the special east-asian font
% support kit in order to be able to draw japanese text.
% How to do this? See...
%
% http://www.coscom.co.jp/japanesefont/index.html
%
% with some more info here:

%
% After that, text drawing seems to "just work" with our "Courier New"
% font. If you don't install the font pack, you'll just see funny little
% squares instead of nice japanese characters...
%
% On MacOS/X you have the choice between three different text
% rendering/layouting methods, as selectable by the Screen preference
% setting 'TextRenderer': The default is 1, which selects Apple's ATSU text
% renderer. A setting of 0 would also select ATSU but would use a different
% method for layout of text. Each method has its own weaknesses in that it
% will have trouble drawing text in some special fonts correctly, so you
% may have to choose the method based on the font to get best results.
% Typical standard fonts are handled correctly by both methods. A setting
% of 2 will use the Linux text rendering plugin (see "help DrawTextPlugin")
% which in our experience handles all fonts well and is of superior
% performance to the OSX ATSU renderer. However, given that historically
% ATSU was used on OSX for many years and each layout and rendering method
% will give slightly different text appearance, for reason of consistency
% we leave the default setting for OSX on 1, instead of using the superior
% setting 2.

try
    % Choosing the display with the highest display number is
    % a best guess about where you want the stimulus displayed.
    screens=Screen('Screens');
    screenNumber=max(screens);
    
    % These preference setting selects the high quality text renderer on
    % each operating system: It is not really needed, as the high quality
    % renderer is the default on all operating systems, so this is more of
    % a "better safe than sorry" setting.
    Screen('Preference', 'TextRenderer', 1);

    % This command uncoditionally enables text anti-aliasing for high
    % quality text. It is not strictly needed here, because the default
    % setting is to let the operating system decide what to use - which is
    % usually anti-aliased rendering. This here just to demonstrate the
    % switch. On WindowsXP or Vista, there also exists a setting of 2 for
    % especially hiqh quality anti-aliasing. However, i couldn't ever see
    % any perceptible difference in quality...
    Screen('Preference', 'TextAntiAliasing', 1);

    % This setting disables user defined alpha-blending for text - not
    % strictly needed, alpha blending is disabled by default.
    Screen('Preference', 'TextAlphaBlending', 0);

    % We want the y-position of the text cursor to define the vertical
    % position of the baseline of the text, as opposed to defining the top
    % of the bounding box of the text. This command enables that behaviour
    % by default. However, the Screen('DrawText') command provides an
    % optional flag to override the global default on a case by case basis:
    Screen('Preference', 'DefaultTextYPositionIsBaseline', 1);
    
    % Open an onscreen window, fullscreen with default 50% gray background:
    w=Screen('OpenWindow', screenNumber, 128);

    % Draw some yellow oval, just to make the scene more interesting...
    Screen('FillOval', w, [255 255 0], [0 0 400 400]);

    % Select 'Courier New' as font, choose a text size of 48pts and a
    % default text style:
    Screen('TextFont',w, 'Courier New');
    Screen('TextSize',w, 48);
    Screen('TextStyle', w, 0);
    
    % The standard 'Hello World' message drawn with the low-level
    % Screen('DrawText') command. We start at x=300 and y=100. We draw in
    % Red+Blue color:
    Screen('DrawText', w, double('Hello'), 300, 100, [255, 0, 255]);

    % Add to the text, starting at the last text cursor position. This
    % should append the text to the previously drawn text...
    Screen('DrawText', w, double('World!'));
    
    % Now for some Unicode text rendering... 
    % The following array of double values encodes some japanese text in
    % UTF-16 Unicode. Unicode text must be passed to Screens text drawing
    % functions as a row-vector of double type, i.e., a numeric row vector,
    % or - if it isn't one already - converted via the double() operator
    % etc... Standard text strings are always interpreted as standard 8 bit
    % ASCII text.
    %
    % According to the donor of this text snippet, it says "Thank you in
    % japanese" -- let's hope he didn't lie to me ;-)
    %
    unicodetext = [26085, 26412, 35486, 12391, 12354, 12426, 12364, 12392, 12358, 12372, 12374, 12356, ...
                    12414, 12375, 12383, 12290, 13, 10];

    % The text above is hard-coded. The following *disabled* snippet of code
    % would have done the same, reading the text from a text file, encoded
    % in so called Shift_JIS encoding, then converting it from Shift_JIS
    % into Unicode UTF-16, then into a double matrix. However, this only
    % works on recent Matlab releases, e.g, R2007a (V7.4) and later. In
    % order to make this demo workable on older Matlabs, we just show you
    % the commented code:
    if 0
        fid = fopen([PsychtoolboxRoot 'PsychDemos/japanese_shiftJIS.txt'], 'r', 'n','Shift_JIS');
        unicodetext = native2unicode(fread(fid),'Shift_JIS'); %#ok<N2UNI>
        fclose(fid);
        disp(unicodetext);
        unicodetext = double(transpose(unicodetext));
    end
