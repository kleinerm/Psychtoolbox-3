% LoadMovieIntoTexturesDemo(moviename [, fromTime=0][, toTime=end][, indexisFrames=0][, benchmark=0][, async=0][, preloadSecs=1][, specialflags=0][, pixelFormat=4])
%
% A demo implementation on how to load a movie into standard
% Psychtoolbox textures for precisely controlled presentation timing and
% presentation order.
%
% Parameters:
% moviename - Filename of moviefile to use. If none is provided, then the
% simple DualDiscs collision movie is used which is part of PTB.
%
% fromTime - Start time (in seconds) from which the movie should be read
% into textures. Defaults to start of movie, if not provided.
%
% toTime - End time (in seconds) upto which the movie should be read
% into textures. Defaults to end of movie, if not provided.
%
% indexIsFrames - If set to 1 then the fromTime and toTime parameters are
% interpreted as frameindex (starting with 0 for the first frame), instead
% of seconds. If set to 2 then presentation timestamps are ignored for the
% decision when to stop loading a movie. This is needed for certain movies
% with a broken encoding of time, as those would stop loading way too early
% otherwise.
%
% benchmark - If you set this parameter to 1, the demo will compute the
% time it takes to load the movie, and - after the movie has been loaded
% into textures - the maximum display speed without syncing to vertical
% refresh. All visual progress feedback is disabled. This is mostly
% useful to benchmark different movie file formats and codecs for their
% relative efficiency on a given machine. A setting of 2 will additionally
% disable test of abort keys during loading of the movie - to discount
% possible pollution of the benchmark results with time spent checking the
% keyboard. A setting of 3 will also skip keyboard queries during the load
% phase, additionally it will not queue up textures in video memory, but
% instead load a texture and then immediately discard it. This is more
% resembling typical movie playback, where a frame is pulled, presented on
% screen, then discarded. It tests a different decoding path in Screen(). A
% setting of 4 will only test decoding performance of the movie, but omit
% creation of actual Psychtoolbox textures for presentation. This allows to
% separate computation time spent in the video decoder from time consumed
% by the graphics driver or graphics card.
%
% async - If you set this parameter to 4, the video decoding engine will
% prebuffer frames ahead of time, up to 'preloadSecs' seconds worth of
% video data. This is unsuitable for playback with audio-video sync, but
% for pure video playback it can decouple decoding from presentation
% further and provide a potential performance boost for very demanding
% playback scenarios.
%
% preloadSecs - How many seconds of video to prebuffer if async == 4?
% Specify a maximum amount in seconds, or the value -1 for unlimited
% prebuffering.
%
% specialflags - Special flags for 'OpenMovie'. E.g., a setting of 1 will
% try to use YUV textures for higher performance, if the installed graphics
% card supports this. A setting of 4 will always use YUV decoding, by use
% of out own builtin YUV decoder, which may be more limited in
% functionality and flexibility, but helpful if highest performance is a
% requirement.
%
% pixelFormat - Format of video texture to create: 1 = Luminance/Grayscale
% only, 2 = Luminance+Alpha, 3 = RGB color, 4 = RGBA, 5 = YUV-422 packed
% pixel, 6 = YUV-I420 planar format. 5 and 6 = Y8-Y800 planar luminance
% only format. Not all formats are supported by all GPU's, operating
% systems and video codecs. Defaults to 4 = RGBA 8 Bit per color channel.
%
%
% How the demo works: Read the source code - its well documented ;-)
%
% This demo "preloads" the movie into textures:
% The whole movie gets read into PTB textures before start of trial. Then
% you show the textures in quick succession like in PlayMoviesDemo. The
% advantage of this approach is exact control over display timing and
% display order: You can show frames in any order you like at any rate you
% like (and that your hardware likes). Disadvantage: Longer trial
% setup time for loading the whole movie, higher memory consumption (keep
% all n frames in memory instead of only the current one) and the inability
% to play sound in sync with video.
%
% To make it a bit more interesting, you can use this demo to "browse" short
% videoclips, e.g., for selection of interesting parts...

% History:
% 12/25/05  mk  Wrote it.
% 02/03/06  mk  Adapted for use on Windows.
% 09/03/09  mk  Add support for frameindex seeking instead of timeindex.
% 30/06/12  mk  Add benchmarking support for new GStreamer modes.

            % Psychtoolbox texture image and returns a handle in
            % 'movietexture'. 'pts' contains a so called presentation
            % timestamp. That is the time (in seconds since start of movie)
            % at which this video frame should be shown on the screen.
            % In case that no valid video texture is available, this function

            % texture will become available anymore, because the end of the

            % The 1 - flag means: Wait for arrival of new frame. Next
