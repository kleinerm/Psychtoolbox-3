function PlayInterlacedMovieDemo(moviename)
%
% PlayInterlacedMovieDemo(moviename)
%
% A simple demo to show playback of interlaced Quicktime movies. Input
% images from the movie are deinterlaced on-the-fly by use of a simple GLSL
% deinterlace shader.
%
% The demo reads a movie file from the file 'moviename' and plays it once,
% then exits.
%
% This demo is early alpha-quality, as is the deinterlacer!
%
% Needs a graphics card with support for fragment shaders and either
% Microsoft Windows with up to date graphics drivers, or MacOS-X 10.4.4 or
% later. On Windows, you'll need to have Quicktime version 6 or later
% installed.
%
% Should work with NVidia GeforceFX 5200 or ATI Radeon 9600 and later, or
% Intel GMA 950.
