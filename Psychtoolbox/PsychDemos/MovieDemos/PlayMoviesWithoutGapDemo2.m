function PlayMoviesWithoutGapDemo2(moviename)
% PlayMoviesWithoutGapDemo2(moviename)
%
% This demo accepts a pattern for a valid moviename, e.g.,
% moviename='*.mpg', then it plays all movies in the current working
% directory whose names match the provided pattern, e.g., the '*.mpg'
% pattern would play all MPEG files in the current directory.
%
% Pressing ESC ends the demo.
%
% Movies are played one after each other. We try to minimize perceptible
% gaps between end of movie i and start of movie i+1 by asynchronous
% loading: While movie i is played back, we ask Psychtoolbox to load the
% next movie i+1 in the background, so startup time for movie i+1 will be
% minimized. This feature is currently only supported with the GStreamer
% movie playback engine, ie., always on GNU-Linux, and on MS-Windows if
% you installed the optional GStreamer runtime (see "help GStreamer" for
% instructions).
%
% This method uses only one 'movie' object for successive, gapless playback
% of many movie files. The advantage is simplicity in use and maximum
% quality in the sense that movies should play back-to-back without any
% significant delays between them. The downside is loss in flexibility.
% This method only works if all movies have exactly the same image size,
% color depth and format, aspect ratio and playback framerate. They may
% only differ in filename, content and duration. Any other difference will
% cause malfunctions, even hard crashes of Matlab or Octave!
%
% If you need a method that is more flexible and can handle movies of
% different format, use the method in PlayMoviesWithoutGapDemoOSX. That
% method works on all operating systems, also with Quicktime, and can
% handle arbitrary movies. The downside is a higher likelyhood of small
% gaps between movies.
%
% History:
% 14.03.2012  mk  Wrote it, derived from PlayMoviesWithoutGapDemoOSX.
