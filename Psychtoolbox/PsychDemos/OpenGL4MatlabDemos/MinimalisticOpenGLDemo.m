function MinimalisticOpenGLDemo(multiSample, imagingPipeline, checkerBoardTexture, doAccumulate)
% MinimalisticOpenGLDemo([multiSample][, imagingPipeline][, checkerBoardTexture][, doAccumulate=0])
%
% This demo demonstrates use of OpenGL commands in a Matlab script to
% perform some very boring 3D rendering in Psychtoolbox.
%
% It shows a single static ball, lit with default lighting and exactly one
% light source. This is meant to demonstrate the minimum amount of code to
% draw anything visible with perspective projection. It also draws a static
% teapot and some little box with a cone as roof.
%
% Then it waits for a keyboard press.
%
% After that it demonstrates how to do basic texture mapping and animation:
% It loads a JPEG image of the earths surface from the filesystem, using
% Matlabs imread() function, then converts the image into a Psychtoolbox
% texture using Screen('MakeTexture'), then provides this texture as a
% standard OpenGL compatible texture using Screen('GetOpenGLTexture').
% This standard texture is applied to a sphere using standard OpenGL commands
% and finally the sphere is drawn as a rotating object in a simple animation
% loop. --> You'll see a rotating earth.
%
% Stop the demo by pressing any key and it will finish.
%
% The optional parameter 'multiSample' allows to enable anti-aliased
% drawing with 'multiSample' samples per pixel on hardware that supports
% this.
%
% The optional parameter 'imagingPipeline' allows (if set to non-zero
% value) to enable the PTB image processing pipeline, just to test that as
% well.
%
% The optional parameter 'checkerBoardTexture' allows (if set to non-zero
% value) to apply a checkerboard texture to the spinning sphere, instead of
% a "earth surface texture image". This demonstrates algorithmic texture
% generation and the use of trilinear mipmap filtering to improve image
% quality for high frequency edges and such...
%
% The optional parameter 'doAccumulate' allows to demonstrate an additional
% motion blur effect by use of the accumulation buffer. If you set the
% imagingPipeline flag to zero and doAccumulate to 1, then use of the -
% nowadays deprecated and extremely slow - accumulation buffer is
% demonstrated. If you set imagingPipeline to 1 and doAccumulate to 2 then
% a new fast technique is demonstrated. Both achieve the same visual effect
% with very similar code, but the latter technique is well supported on
% recent hardware, much more flexible and much faster.
%
%
% Notable implementation details regarding use of OpenGL:
%
% The call InitializeMatlabOpenGL at the top of the script initializes the
% Matlab-OpenGL toolbox and enables the 3D gfx support in Psychtoolbox to
% allow proper interfacing between the OpenGL toolbox and Psychtoolbox.
%
% After this call, all OpenGL functions are made available to Matlab with
% the same - or a very similar - calling syntax as in the C programming
% language. OpenGL constants are made available in a format that is optimized
% for Matlab, where the first underscore is replaced by a dot, e.g.,
% GL.DEPTH_TEST, instead of the C-style GL_DEPTH_TEST.
%
% In order to execute OpenGL 3D drawing commands to draw 3D stims into a
% Psychtoolbox Onscreen- or offscreen window, one needs to call
% Screen('BeginOpenGL', windowPtr). After OpenGL drawing and before
% execution of standard Screen() commands, one needs to call
% Screen('EndOpenGL', windowPtr) to tell Psychtoolbox that 3D drawing is
% finished.
%
% Some OpenGL functions that return complex parameters to Matlab are not
% yet implemented - this is work in progress. The performance will be also
% lower than when coding in a compiled language like C++ or C -- that's the
% Matlab tax you'll have to pay ;-)
%
% The toolbox checks after execution of each single OpenGL command if it
% caused some error. It aborts your script with an error message, if so. If
% you are happy with your code and want to disable these error checks in
% order to squeeze out a bit more speed, you can call
% InitializeMatlabOpenGL(0,0) instead of InitializeMatlabOpenGL at the top
% of your script. This will disable automatic error-checking. You can then
% use the commands gluErrorString or glGetError to perform manual error-checks
% in your code if you want.
%
% Apart from that, use of OpenGL for Matlab is the same as OpenGL for the C
% programming language. If you are used to OpenGL coding in C, it should be
% a zero effort transition to code in Matlab+PTB. If you don't know OpenGL
% then get yourself one of the many good books or visit one of the many
% OpenGL tutorials on the internet.
%
% The OpenGL Red Book is a great introduction and reference for OpenGL
% programming. Release 1.0 is available online, later releases can be
% purchased in any good book store:

% http://www.opengl.org/documentation/red_book_1.0/

% the vertex colors. The Phong lighting model is a coarse approximation of
% real world lighting with ambient light reflection (undirected isotropic light),
% diffuse light reflection (position wrt. light source matters, but observer
% position doesn't) and specular reflection (ideal mirror reflection for highlights).
%
% The model does not take any object relationships into account: Any effects
% of (self-)occlusion, (self-)shadowing or interreflection of light between
% objects are ignored. If you need shadows, interreflections and global illumination
% you will either have to learn advanced OpenGL rendering and shading techniques
% to implement your own realtime shadowing and lighting models, or
% compute parts of the scene offline in some gfx-package like Maya, Blender,
